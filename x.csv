8,"i had a pretty dirty car and i used the mr. clean starter kit. i followed all the directions.i also washed my car in the shade, and i rinsed and soaped the car in portions as one reviewer mentioned. i waited about 30mins or more for the car to dry and the only parts that were really clean and shiny were the windows. it still left a lot of dirt on my car, despite all the scrubbing i did during the soaping step. it even took more water than what i would have used washing it the old fashion way. i looked that the faq sheet that came with the kit and it said that if you see streaks it may be dirt, and all you have to do is go through the steps again to get rid of it. it's just a hassle. at least i can wash my house windows with it until the filter get's used up. otherwise it's a waste of money",0
9,"i bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  when i first used it, i followed the directions as indicated on the box.  worked fair the first time, i mean i could have just used my dads power washer but no, i am a pioneer and want to try new things.  so then i used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left scum everywhere!  this wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  i spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this scum off the car.  so i swore i wouldn't use it after all that happend.  so today i decided to wash my car because i'm moving to arizona in a day.  i used the power washer with a new bottle of mr. clean soap. i mean hey...what would go wrong....more of that scum, so here i am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  mr. clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one",0
10,"i bought this product on a whim.  i was looking for carwash detergent at safeway, and the mr. clean autodry was on sale.  curious, i gave it a try.first of all, this unit wastes a lot of water.  after washing and rinsing, you have to apply filtered water all over the car from a distance of one feet.  it feels like spray painting.then you wait for the water to evaporate.  problem is, i live in san franisco, ca -- nothing dries in this climate without help.  if i hadn't hand dried my car, i'd still be waiting for the water to evaporate.another odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using the mr. clean soap and unit.  it's as though it left a residue.  i'm not sure what it is.but i'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow, the old-fashioned way ..",0
11,"i seriously hope that the price tag i am seeing is ($7,000+) is a mistake..",0

27,"if this gauge cost $20 i would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price i see for these gauges i think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!as mentioned hose is very inflexible at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and i am trying to repair with quality materials, as i still hope to use the gauge part anyway. i would not buy again",0
28,"it appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously.  the reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge.  the reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.the quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it.  the hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.i used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold i mean 45f, this is houston...) and the display read 'lo', indicating a low battery.  so essentially the gauge was useless.  the hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it",0
29,"as other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings.  it may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game.  calling it a ""racing"" gauge is ridiculous",0
30,"i had the same problem described by r. nielsen.  the gauge would not take a new reading after i pressed the release valve to let air out.  it only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  i called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that i should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  i returned it to amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  i contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  i have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  the second replacement also had the problem.  customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.six weeks later (november 27th) i received a properly functioning gauge.  so it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  there was just a very large run of defective ones.  at this point, i would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.if yours is defective, you should contact accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.",0

33,i bought this item and i literally hate it.  they make it seem so simple and easy but the blade does not do a good job in removing water from car surfaces.  i would only recommend it for doing windows.  much easier to use chamois or regular old terrycloth towels,0

36,i had a previous non-brand name digital tire gauge and it worked great but eventually died. i bought this one thinking it would be better. the first time i used it i couldn't get a good connection at all and it kept giving me multiple readings.  it also does not seem to keep the number on the display after the reading. it would disappear before i could read it fully.,0

55,"if you've seen the movie ""cars"" and figure that it's time that you gave your rusty bucket the ""radiator springs"" make-over special, you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks.sure - it says ""new car scent"", and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything - but i would definitely not use this stuff in my car.  first of all, it doesn't smell anything like the interior of a new car, and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal, even if you drive a hummer.  it is super-concentrated, and a one second blast is enough to saturate a 10 ft x 10 ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell, which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria, smoke and odors. i can't vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing, sanitizing, bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors, because after the first test spray (in my office on a friday afternoon) i vacated the premises under duress, and by monday morning it had thankfully dissipated.  i've never used it again, and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing-gummy ever invented, the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living, breathing people. to be fair, the write-up never actually states that it is for cars, instead listing schools, medical facilities and food-processing areas, but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car?  and why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory?  the claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn't happen for me, and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this, i couldn't recommend it.  amanda richards, july 28, 2006",0

""i am a visiting nurse. i'm in and out of the car all day,"" black said. ""i hate using the air conditioning because it uses up all my gas. so i thought this little gadget for $14.99 would be the perfect thing.""after shipping and handling, $23 for auto cool as seen on tv. the same sun that makes your car unbearably hot will keep it cool and comfortable thanks to a solar powered fan that blows the hot air out of your parked car. but does it really do that?on a hot day last week, we decided to find out. inside the auto cool box, we get our solar powered fan and some weather stripping.the only thing you need is a pair of scissors.now they tell you to check either the front or back window - whichever is getting the most sun.we choose the back window and we're going to put the window down four or five inches.the solar powered fan starts working the second the sun's rays hit it. no problem there. we hang it on the window, fan side in.next comes the weather stripping.so we've installed auto cool. now we are going to go inside, wait about an hour and check it and see if it's any less than 110 degrees.while we are away, the thermometer slowly moves - in the wrong direction.one hour later, it's 118 degrees inside that car.we are stunned that auto cool didn't work at all. it just got hotter inside. but just to be fair, we test one more car.we make sure to start off the car is relatively cool. this time, it's 80 degrees.we quickly install auto cool. by now, the temperature is 90 degrees. while diane is off doing hers, a patient visits. she says it will take about 20 minutes. in the meantime, that solar powered fan is working we can even feel the hot air blowing out of the car.will it work this time? twenty minutes later - it's 110 degrees.maybe if we hadn't used auto cool, our car would have been 111 degrees instead of 110, but that high up, we don't care. not only does it not do that, this is the worst product we've tested so far.don't waste your money on this one.",0

177,my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful. the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. i thought it was too drippy. i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. i would not recommend this conditioner,0
178,this foam product by jonathan is okay.  the reviews on his products are highly overrated.  the price doesn't bother me at all.  there are better foams for thin and limp hair,0

230,"i bought this product at sephora.  i had it for about two weeks and used it only 2 times.  when i tried to use it after that, the little red light wouldn't come on and it just wouldn't work.  i took it back to sephora for an exchange since i was still within the 30 day exchange period.  the second one worked for about two months...then the same thing happened.  i was only using it maybe once or twice a week, the most.  this product is horrible.  i never dropped it or anything like that.  in fact, as soon as it would cool down after using, i would place it back in the box it came in.  i am actually in the process of returning it to the manufacturer.  honestly, i wanted a good flat iron and i thought this was a good product because it was expensive...big mistake.  my friend bought a straight iron for about $100 and she's had it for almost a year.  she also straightens her hair a lot more often than i do.  i don't know why i didn't ask her where she got hers.  please read all the reviews before you make this purchase.  if you don't believe me, wait to see if someone you know buys it so you can find out first hand how bad this product is.",0
231,"this product did not dry my hair as described on the box.  it did straighten my hair, but that was all.  i had to dry my hair with a blow dryer and then use this t3 iron which eliminates the whole reason for buying it.",0
232,"on my third use, i set it down on the carry case and it sizzled. i looked more closely and it started shooting sparks out of the cord, right where it is connected to the handle! i immediately unplugged it, and now there's a hole in it where the sparks were coming out. i am so grateful i wasn't using it on my hair when this happened! what with the straightening balm i was using and everything, my hair could've easily started on fire",0
233,"this hairspray was too wet and too stiff.  it ruined my clean, freshly washed hair and made my blonde locks stiff and darker - yuck!!!!i love the voluminizing shampoo & conditioner as well as the voluminizing foam - but when i lightly sprayed the ""finishing"" hair spray- it ruined everything.  i will stick to an areosol hairspray instread of a pump.  sorry jonathan :",0
234,this product works well when i use it with a curling iron.  the low rating is for the cost.  i just don't think it is worth over $20,0
235,product made my hair sticky and gooey. i am a personal fan of his and it got rushed to market.  needs re formulatin,0
236,"i have dried my hair daily for 20 years now. i bought the t3 tourmaline with great excitement. come on - its 200$, the most i have ever used on a hairdryer. i did not reduce my hair drying time at all, but it did make my hair less frizzy and more shiny..but all in all- too much money for too little help!nor",0
237,"i'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. but i'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. ""most ionic and infrared"" is gibberish. tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. i'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam",0
238,"i bought this because i have fine hair that needs to be washed every day and i get tired of washing it.  i thought i could use this every other day and get by. however, it doesn't make your hair look freshly washed; it is just ok.  it takes ""bed head"" hair and makes it look acceptable for a little while.  after a couple of hours though, my hair looks oily and stringy again.i use it before i take the kids to school and it gets me thru the morning.  then i end up washing my hair later",0
239,"i like jonathan anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  it smelled like swamp water.  his other products smell great.  i don't know what happened to this one.",0
240,"i bought this because a friend had it and it smelled wonderfully of roses.  there must be a quality control problem.  my bottle had no noticible, pleasant sent and therefore did nothing to freshen my hair.  i was only trying to go 1 day without washing.  what a disappointing product and a waste of my money.  :",0
241,"after using this product, i felt less than fresh.  then i realized that it is only for use on the hair and skin on your head.  i would have been better off using a can of evain spray and gotten the same effect at less money",0
242,"i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel ""fresh"".  in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey - nothing fresh about it.",0
243,"i tried doing a patti labelle do, where my hair stood up at an angle and it fell over all limp and oily.  my hair felt dirtier than when i put dirt in it",0
244,"this was terrible - i tried getting my weave shaped like a helicopter for my prom, but it turn out looking like a melting ceiling fan. like in ""something about mary,"" splooge would have been cheaper, and would have held bettah.",0
245,i have to say that for a gel it had the same consistency and feel of k-y jelly - frankly i am not familiar with personal lubricants but that said there was the smell that reminded me of my gynecological exams.,0
246,"this product did not live up to jonahan's ""claims"" on the bottle.i cannot even begin to describe how bad it was and how it did not work nor live up to his promise",0
247,"i had high hopes for this stuff. i have watched blow out and know that he knows his stuff when it comes to hair, but i cant seem to get this stuff to actually do anything for my curls and waves. i have tried it on wet hair, damp hair, dry hair-no discernable difference. i will stick to my frederic fekkai products-they actually work",0
248,"i spent a lot of money on this product & waited with anticipation for it to arrive. when i applied it, it did nothing to ""create"" curl and didn't even define the curls that i already had. my hair was limp and frizzy by days end. it smelled nice & that's about it. cheap-o suave gel or mousse works better and creating and holding curl",0
249,"okay, i'll admit. i bought into the hype. oooo, no ""sulfates""... oooo, ""essential water"".... oooo, ""all natural"" - no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this - ""vegan"" shampoo and conditioner...i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped $35 on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair. and what a difference it made...the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair: styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely ""dessicant"" shampoo. and no amount of the so-called conditioner helped to right the wrong! i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results. after 3 days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was, i returned the product.this product truly deserves 0 stars!!",0
250,"i was excited to purchase jonathan product after watching two seasons of blow out.  unfortunately, i was really disappointed after using this conditioner on my hair.  my hair is very thick and after using this conditioner it left my hair a sticky and tangled mess.unfortunately, the fragrance of the conditioner is great but that's about it",0
251,"i purchased this item after seeing jonathan's show.  as much as i enjoyed his program, i am sorry to say that this product is just terrible.  it weighed down my hair, and made my hair look greasy before i was even done styling!  the day after using the product, my hair looked like an oil slick!  i do wish jonathan much success, but these products need a lot of work.  very disappointing after spending almost 60$ for two bottles that remain full in the back of my cupboard",0
252,my naturally curly hair is thinning and i thought this conditioner would be helpful. the conditioner did not handle the tangles in my hair nor did it make it feel conditioned. i thought it was too drippy. i nearly used half a bottle by pouring it into my hand. i would not recommend this conditioner,0
253,"....comes hefty disappointment. andis is a good brand of clipper, ""however"" $80 for this pair of clippers is $70 too much. the power is weak and it takes about 24 hours to fully charge. these clippers are not designed for professional use at all. i am not a barber, my wife cuts my hair every 2 weeks or so. it does a decent fade job and my 2 boys(3 and 4) are mixed and seems to cut through their hair with a little more ease than mine. however it seems that my past corded clippers had more power which translate to easier cutting and trimming. my wife has to constantly go over various spots multiple times because it did not hit the spot the first or 2nd time.my recommendation is to do your research and go with another pair of andis clippers, stay away from this pair, or you'll be finding yourself writing a review saying i agree with the first guy that reviewed this product",0
254,"all of the ""glowing"" and ""raving"" reviews of this product were all entered on april 24 or april 25.  coincidence?  i think not.  these are people paid by strivectin for their ""honest"" reviews...",0
255,"i bought this product thinking that it was so pricey it just had to work. well it doesn't. i followed the directions and went through two bottles with no results what so ever. i'm 24, 23 when i tried the product... no reason it should not have worked if it actually worked at all. if it doesn't work it should get 1 star because it is not delivering on its promise and the promise is why people buy this stuff. i wish i hadn't listened to the raves on this product",0
256,i find it strangely odd that everyone who gave this product a fantastic review:1. has only ever reviewed one product on amazon  2. all seem to have been posted on the 24th. caveat emptor,0
257,"i bought the cream hoping to get rid of, or at least lighten stretch marks from pregnancy.  i have used it three times a day for 3 months and have seen no results.  it smells horrible and having to apply 3 times a day is really a pain in the hind parts.  i was very optimistic after reading some of the other reviews.  i'm now very disappointed.  if something sounds too good to be true, it is",0
258,"i used to love curious. i asked for it for my birthday and my boyfriend bought me the large bottle with the atomizer and the lotion. however, a few months after i got it, it started to smell funny... over time the atomizer became very hard and had a sticky film all over it. when i opened the bottle i gaged at the stench. i poured it down the sink and it was yellow. i do not recommend buying this product and if you must have this scent please don't buy it with the atomizer. the lotion still smells good.",0
259,"like many others, my perfume turned yellow as well. i think it only happens with the atomizer. perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume. i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good. the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set. i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about 60 dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf-life. i am never buying perfume from britney spears. obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume.",0
260,"i immediately fell in love with the fragrance, and my husband bought me the really big bottle.  i wanted to savor it, and make it last.  much to my dismay it turned an ugly pee yellow and now smells like pure rubbing alcohol.  it also formed a nasty, crusty substance all over the pump and bottle.  i am soooo disappointed!!!",0
261,"i received my curious perfume not last christmas, but the christmas before.. and i was so excited, i had already been through the shops at least 15 times just trying it on over and over, using every tester i could find.when i got it, i was just as happy and used it just *so* carefully, i wanted it to last for years. i got the one that comes with the pump, the largest bottle.... anyway, i now look over to my dresser and see it sitting there. yellow.my curious perfumewentyellowand apparently mine was not the only one that went bright yellow, my brothers girlfriends is also a lovely urine coloured yellow. it also grew a sticky coat of curious smelling...crud.. around the bottle and just today i went over to it, only to find it leaking all over my table... i squeeze the pump and it is rock hard... i look over to the nozzle and it is covered in a thick crust, the whole thing has crusted over and is leaking, i squeezed it again and  my curious perfume  splerted out..it now smells offand doesn't really look all that fantastic as you may have guessed.i am disgusted and so so angrythat perfume i wanted so bad and was so excited to get now sits on the table surrounded by it's own disgusting pool of crust and leaking hardened perfume (i didn't even know that was possible) i am disgustedwhat a cheap nasty nasty product.do not buy it unless you think you're going to use it within a period of 1 year.good work!a product as cheap and nasty as the person endorsing it",0
262,"when curious came out, i smelled it and had to buy it. i acknowledged at the time that the bottle was probably half of the reason i bought it (unfortunately). the bottle is beautiful and attracts many customers by itself. the fragrance is very pretty and sweet. it goes on very strong but fades quickly, which it annoying. also, maybe six months after i bought it, i noticed that it started smelling a little different. i left it in my bathroom for a while without moving it because of the difference. today, i picked the bottle up and the sprayer was covered in this ....disgusting filmy substance, which had also dripped down the sides of the bottle and created a ring of filth on my countertop. it was really really gross. by the looks of it, the perfume had some sort of chemical reaction with the metal from the nozzle of the sprayer. anyways, the whole bottle smells awful now and it's digusting. the bottle design was it's awful putrid demise, which ruined $50. it's really unfortunate too, because i loved the bottle and the fragrance when i got it and now it's junk",0
263,"i had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. not so. the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.i have used many creams. so far art of shaving is the best. casswell massey is ok as is aveda. avoid truefitt",0
264,"omg - if you decide to use this use it sparingly!!!!  i can't stress it enough.  i decided to get the philosophy acne kit because i had a few minor breakouts and clogged pores.  i had been using clean & clear salicylic (sp?) acid products with no trouble so figured this wouldn't be much different.  boy was i wrong!  the first week was great; week #2 the nightmare began... i wound up these huge, brownish-red, sore, swollen, itchy bumps/scabs on my face.  i have since stopped that portion of the treatment and am now moisturizing my face back to health.  last night my bf said it looks better than the 'pizza face' from the philosophy products.  yikes!  try at your own risk but take it slow",0
265,omg my face..i had 5 zit i put one drop of stuff on each and there was a slight burning sensation for a while.. and when i woke up the next morning all the spots were huge and brown looking..it looked like brown moles or something..when i washedmy face with dial and a wash cloth those spots started to bleed!! im on the phone with a represenative now im sooo angry i even canceled work because i look hideous now i have 3 bright red spots and / 2 are still brown  open-sore-spots on my face and im devastated..i had never tried this before but read the reviews and thought it would be perfect..this is not the case buyer beware!!,0
266,"never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier, which i am very happy with.i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.",0
267,"i just purchased the small bottle(thank god) of the ojon ultra hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  it seems like it made my hair a little softer, but the smell is horrendous.  i have gotten the worst headache from the smell of this product. so overall it may make my hair feel softer, but there is no way i will put this stuff on my head again.  the rest is going in the trash",0
268,i got this product as a sample.  it has the worst scent ever.  it took me 2 days of washing to get the horrible smell out of my hair,0
269,"i do not like this shampoo at all. in fairness, i did give it two stars because it may not be good for coarse african american hair. it seemed to make my hair clump together and made it difficult to comb through when wet. the one thing that did detangle it however was the ojon hydrating conditioner which i do love.  did have a pleasant scent and foamed up well",0
270,this thing was such a waste.  it does not get cold enough to do anything.  it also won't stay flat against your face to give any soothing sensation to your eyes. overpriced and worthless item,0
271,"i can't believe how much amazon and other retail stores (like sephora)charge for this.  i buy prevage md (which is double the strength of regular prevage) from my plastic surgeon's office and i only pay 120$.  why would you pay 30 dollars more for something that is only half the strength of the good stuff?  if you don't want to go to the doctor to buy the md version, then you can get it off ebay for around 100$..",0
272,"i bought this product in the color paparazzi from sephora - online, i read wonderful reviews about it in the magazines.  i was very disappointed when i finally got it and tried it. there is way too much glitter in it for anyone over 13.  i could not wear this to work or even an evening out as i would feel like a clown.  the only place this would look semi-good at would be a nightclub where it is dark. i was hoping for more of a shimmer than pure glitter.  i do not recommend this product at all. i also returned this promptly back to sephora.",0
273,"not really impressed with this product. it applies okay, but the colors look really bright and odd on. the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product. i like lancome's eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice",0
274,"i was excited to try out this product, given all the rave reviews. but after just 2 uses my face broke out in a rash! it's awful! and i do not have sensitive skin by any stretch of the imagination. i would not recommend this product.",0
275,"i have thick, wavy hair and this product did nothing but make it feel wirey and frizzy. i don't think it is worth the money when i have found other poducts (such as redken) that work better and cost less",0
276,"i was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when i opened it and smelled the fragrance.it smells exactly like paint.  then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.i will not buy any more philosophy products.  the less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from target, wal-mart, etc",0
277,"i love falling in love fragrance and the shower gel, but this lotion is not getting as much love from me. it doesn't smell the same to me, and on a bad day, makes me a little sick.  it's sweeter smelling.  thing is, i need lotion, and i don't want competing scents.  otherwise, i might have rated it even lower",0
278,i'm all about lip plumping glosses and this one sucked.  it has a really slippery constistancy and did not plump my lis at all.  i'll stick with my too faced lip injection products,0
279,"actually, i would give the product 5 stars, and the packaging a minus-2. citylips really does work, plumping and hydrating; it does required repeated applications. but the packaging results in about 10-12% of the (expensive) material being completely unavailable!  worse, if you try to wiggle the (too-short) applicator in order to get the last 10%, the container breaks at the neck (actually, one came already cracked in my case!).  true, they do offer some colors at 2/3 price, but most effective is to apply clear, and go outside the lipline-and the clear almost never has gone on sale!",0
280,"works as a good lip balm but i didt really see a difference in the size of my lips, wouldnt buy it again.",0
281,"i used two tubes in one month - one for daytime wear, and one for nighttime and when i wasn't going out (clear).  i like the product: how it looks and smoothes out my lips, but i just cannot afford to pay $60 a month on my lips!  if they lower the price by $10-12, i will buy it again......but not until they do :-",0
282,"i am so disappointed!!!!!!!!!!! i ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends, and reading great reviews.  all of the reviews i read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has, but i never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak.  don't get me wrong, i do not want my fragrance to enter a room before i do (after all, it is not the 80's anymore lol), but i also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that i take off skin!  the scent is beautiful, i would love to wear it!  but 20 minutes after i sprayed it on, i could barely detect the fragrance.  as sometimes it is harder to ""smell your own perfume"", i asked my hubby and friends for their opinions.  they could barely smell it either.  i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it at all.  if philosophy can create this scent with staying power, they will have a customer for life.  as it stands now, i would not recommend anyone buy this product.  it is a very disappointing waste of money",0
283,"i am such a huge fan of the philosophy grace line that i thought i would really love this, too.  i find that it is much too light for me.  it does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  i guess i'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice i'm wearing it.  nobody has said anything so far.  the shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  i will stick with amazing grace, baby grace and pure grace.  those are wonderful",0
284,"i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  the trouble started occurring about two months after using.  one brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!my experience with the customer service has been terrible.  they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!",0
285,"this perfume deserves negative stars. i was in macy's when i saw this fragrance on the dior counter. the bottle is gorgeous, and i really like hypnotic poison and miss dior cherie, so i figured i would give this one a try. i really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. it is horrible. white floral scents are generally not my thing, but i can usually tolerate them. this was the worst perfume i ever smelled. it's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. i was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. disgusting. not worth the money at all. if you want to buy this scent, i would recommend buying dove deodorant spray instead. it's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. i wonder if it really is the dove deodorant but repackaged...hmm..",0
286,"at first, it's a beautiful floral scent, then it dries to something that gives me a headache.  i cannot detect what smell it is, but it's not pleasant.  i cannot detect vanilla in this at all.",0
287,"i was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews, but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so i gave it a try.  i love it!  it's surprising.  it changes.  on me, when i first put it on it takes on a white floral scent.  when i first applied it, i was surprised that it seemed like a floral"".. but hours later i was smelling vanilla.  i was very surprised to realize it was me!  very interesting! very cool!  lighter than the original poison, it may become my spring/summer choice",0
288,"it doesn't smell woody to me at all. well, maybe a fake, pinesol-type of smell. it smells really artificial and almost chemical-y. i guess it's not so bad, and some people might like it, but i didn't",0
289,"i loved the smell in the magazines so i decided to get it.  well...it was good at first...and then i got tired.  it smells a little cheap and sort of like pine.  i sometiems use it, but let me tell you it smells good on your armpits (that's what i use it for).  i think this smell reminds me of some kind of cologne that has been worn for tooo long",0
290,this item doesn't include everything that is mention in the details.  i wouldn't even pay a dollar for it. don't purchase this item!!!!!!!!!!,0
291,i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about. i was not impressed. it smells just like ordinary soap-so what? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. you can get soap that smells better at wal-mart!,0
292,"i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.  &lt;for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line",0
293,"nanoparticles???? i was in the process of re-ordering this item until i read the description.  apparently you're using the public to ascertan whether or not these nanoparticles are safe.  thanks a lot, lancome!  not on my face!",0
294,"sorry to say i found this nail polish remover to be extremely drying, something i haven't experienced with other removers.     in addition, it takes several applications to successfully remove just one coat of polish.        on the plus side, it's fragrance free and reasonable in price",0
295,"i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours. when i went back to get a lighter color, it did the same. i think there's just too much yellow in this foundation. and considering it's oil-free, it didn't really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday.i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you. or if you're looking for a similar oil-free foundation, i would highly recommend laura mercier oil-free or chanel dpf",0
296,"as much as i love fat girl slim, i thought i'd try serious cellulite soap to go with it. i was not impressed at all. it has a terrible medicine like smell that lingers on you and after a few washes there are no more dimples on the soap. it was what i thought it would be at all. the size of the bar was good, the price is good, but i am not pleased at all with the quality",0
297,"the texture of this cleanser is waxy.  i could barely get it off my face, and i broke out badly after using it.  i double checked the packaging to make sure it really was supposed to be a facial cleanser, and that i hadn't mistakenly put some other product on my face.  it smells wonderful, though.  i tried to think of alternate uses for the product, but finally threw it away",0
298,i was so excited to try this product from all of the great reviews that i read on it- boy where they wrong. i used this product for 2 months and saw no difference in my skin at all. i have used a lot of products and would have to rate this down at the bottom of my list- especially for how much it cost,0
299,i haven't had an outbreak of acne in about 5 years until i started using this cream. i kept using it thinking that my huge cysts couldn't possibly be from this very pricey stuff. i went to the dermo and she said to stay away from these thick creams specifically for anti-aging because they are horrible for your skin. i went back to my cheap neutrogena lotion for anti- aging and it felt sooo much better and lighter and within a week my skin cleared up. i didn't even realize how very thick this stuff was until i started back on my neutrogena. i feel so bad about the $$$ i lost and i wish i would've gotten a sample first. i encourage you to do the same.,0
300,"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0

302,"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",0
303,"i hate to say this since philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara i have ever used. it clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. it does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. about half of them remain attached to your lashes, and i've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. everything else i've ever tried from philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from lancome",0
304,"this clarifying lotion is too harsh. i used it once and my skin is itchy, dry and red. i think i'm allergic to it. basically, the chemicals in these products are really harmful. most of the time, people don't need these products. all they do is clog up what nature has given us. this lotion is horrible",0
305,"i purchased the entire 3-step clinique system including: clinique facial soap with dishclinique clarifying lotion 2clinique dramatically different moisturizing lotionabout the same time i started using the clinique 3-step system, i began wearing foundation for the first time. i found that my skin started breaking out and began to be dry in some spots. i stopped using the foundation after about 3 months because i thought that was the issue. however, my skin problems did not improve and i even moved down a level in the clinique system to one for more sensitive skin.however, after about 7 months of daily use, my skin was not improving and i found a review of the clinique 3-step system from paula begoun. her research indicates that all of clinique's facial soaps in the 3-step system are too irritating for all skin types. her research also stated that all clarifying lotions (1-4) contain alcohol and clarifying lotion 2 contains menthol which make them too irritating for all skin types. i never thought that my skin care products were the cause of my flaky skin and break outs. apparently, the products dried out my skin making it flaky in some areas and in response, my skin started producing more oil to compensate for the dryness-which made me break out in other areas. i switched to paula's choice facial products and i occasionally use cetaphil. after i made the switch, my skin slowly began recovering. unfortunately, now i have some acne scars on my cheeks as a result of using the clinique 3-step system. it makes me sad because before, my skin was healthy and for the most part clear. i do want to be fair to clinique. they have some great products---i use their city block sheer spf 15, advanced stop signs eye spf 15 and i wear clinique happy perfume which smells amazing. i hope this review proves helpful to other women so you don't have to go through what i went through! clinique does have some great products in their line, but they do need to  reformulate their 3-step skin care system.",0
306,"i'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes.  i seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing.  yes the scent is great, i love it.  but the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me.  really really disapointed.  i guess i'm just used to the channel and ralph lauren lines.  they are quality and can last most of the day.  this stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days.",0
307,i like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister.  maybe i just have a defective one but i need to unscrew the top and dab it on,0
308,"the key to my heart lipgloss chain is a very cute, original idea, but it fails to deliver the quality worthy of the hard candy name. the reviews here have all stated that this is a cute keychain, that the gloss is nice and that the colors are pretty. all very true. i got my keychain in the pixie tones and they're girly and pretty and i was feeling pretty cool about it. however, for me, the disenchantment came with the mechanics of it. now, i've always been a fairly careful person, i'm not klutzy nor do i drop or lose things. my keys are as normal as a standard set of keys can be, i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that's normal and yet, after less than a week the keychain hinges had broken twice. the first time i was able to make a little mess of superglue and scotch tape and managed to rescue it and put it back into almost normal condition, the second time however, i only noticed that the entire thing had fallen completely apart because i saw only half of the keychain remained and my keys were all covered in pink goo. how did it come apart like this? i honestly have no idea as my keys had only made the very normal trajectory between the ignition and my purse. i can honestly only chalk it up to really, really shoddy craftsmanship which may be adequate for a dresser-top lipgloss but never for something that could get even remotely more movement than that. it was a good idea but too low-quality to be fit for the purpose of a keychain. this is not the way to go for gloss on your keys",0
309,"i love the smell of this perfume. however, it doesn't stay on. i have been wearing perfume for 18 years now and have used several different kinds without a problem. i was sold by sjp on this perfume when she appeared on oprah. loved it when i went to the counter at the mall to check it out. i have been using it for about 2 months now and it just doesn't last. about an hour after i put it on i (or my husband) can't smell it anymore. trust me, i learned to apply it liberally and it still doesn't stay. totally disappointed",0
310,"as some people before me said already, this scent isn't that lovely. i am a sjp-fan, and i was almost certain i would love the new perfume of this stylish lady.it isn't released yet in holland, but i found a sample in germany where it is already released. i was disappointed. the smell isn't bad, but it's isn't something i would like to smell like. it isn't lovely at all. it is too sporty. i expected something more flowery. the scent reminded me most of deodorant (cheap brands) or toilet-refreshener. so, although i am a sjp-fan, i wouldn't like to smell like her. a pity.my favourite perfumes are (as a comparison): beyond paradise (estee lauder), curious (britney spears), couture! (moschino), live (j.lo), tumulte (christian lacroix), several escade limited edition perfumes and gucci rush 2",0
311,"after hearing oprah's rave reviews of this perfume, and seeing that it was one of her favorite things for 2005, i thought for sure i'd love it.  i ran right out to the nearest department store for a sample of it!  i just had to see for myself...well, i was not impressed.  the scent is so strong and overwhelming that it actually seemed to ""catch"" in my throat.  i accidentally got some on my hand and after four hand washings i could still smell it.  i guess, for those of you who like this perfume, that's probably a good thing.anyway, i think this perfume is too ""old lady"" for my taste.  it reminded me of j. lo's glow.  which i also have and don't like.for comparisons sake, perfumes i do like are britney spears' curious, clinique happy, escada island kiss and lucky you",0
312,"i bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed.  application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and i can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof).  if you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you.  i prefer a softer line, so this didn't.also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.i'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring.  i didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but i did have flakes, so i'm still not happy with it.this is definitely not worth the pricetag",0
313,"my husband was revolted by the smell of this product.  i have bad sinuses, so it didn't bother me.  as far as effectiveness goes, there are no miracle ingredients in this concoction.  i used it everyday, several times a day, and noticed no lasting improvement in the look or feel of the skin on my hands.  at a cost of almost $20 for 8.5oz., i got skunked",0
314,"shiseido is known for creating top quality products that do not irritate even the most sensitive of skin. my mother and many of my friends mothers swear by their benefiance line.  i cannot tell you how disappointed i am in their pureness line. it is for oily/problem skin.  i have been using this for about 10 days and while it goes on nicely and has this wonderful, light, clean fragrance, it had made my skin even oilier.  i thought my skin just had to get acclimated to a new skincare regimen but this is not the case",0
315,"i'm a huge fan of the majority of the philosophy line, along with adoring the amazing grace scent!  i thought this scrub would be perfect for the spring into summer period because of the light floral scent.  boy was i wrong!!  if you love amazing grace, this smells nothing like it.  it smells like plastic flowers.. not appealing at all.  even my fiance made a comment that the bathroom smelled like melting plastic.  if you want a fantastic exfoliator, try gingerbread man or the margarita scrub.. those are devine!  i think i'll stick to my amazing grace body lotion from now on",0
316,this scrub didn't moisturize my skin at all. and the salt stings! it seems like it is more of a cleanser than anything and the scent is boring,0
317,i bought this soap just to see what all the philosophy hype is all about. i was not impressed. it smells just like ordinary soap-so what? the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does lather well. you can get soap that smells better at wal-mart!,0
318,"this is one of the cutest shower caps i've owned, but it didn't keep my hair dry -- the cap kept sliding up my head.  sephora's shower cap also did the same thing, but, at least, it only cost $5. so far, i've found the best shower caps are the complimentary ones i receive when i occasionally stay in a hotel.",0
319,"the philosophy states on their cosmetic's containers: there is no such thing as unblemished skin. well, this is for sure true, when you use this kit kit. i have pictures to proove, that for more than a month of using acne kit kit not even one acne spot dissapeared. i'm combining it with oxygen peel- this doesn't help either. i was as happy as young horse to have all this products for around $40: night and day cream, facial wash and blemish serum. all they do ( maybe except of the wash) is drying out the skin. soon i have had to buy super-moisturizing revitalizing night cream and sensitive skin, high spf day cream( my skin started showing dark, sun-exposure spots, altough i was using an spf filter) and finally no acne was or is gone. i dont get it- i was having better results using $0,97 hydrogen peroxide after toner than this hydrogen peroxide- based line of cosmetics. for the same price i could have bought stuff that really works-the one that vanessa williams is happy with. i know cause i tried it, didn't make my skin feel like sahara and will be my next choice. save your money. p.s. the oxygen peel is o.k. dough",0

321,"i bought this lip liner 3 times and i was always disappointed because no matter how hard you try to put it on your lips, it just wont glide. you will have to rub it hard on your lips to line em. clinique liners are the worst one in the market",0

323,"i bought this stuff from the shopping channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until i went to get my hair colored. the color didn't take!my hair is shoulder length, and i only used the ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry. the color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that i had put the ojon on! the smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the hair spray was disgusting. people remarked that i had overdosed on perfume, so i had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair.i definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair.",0

326,"although it is great others love this product, i did not get that same streak of good luck. i had been using clinique for years, merely because it was affordable and a lot of people i knew used it. however, every time i took pictures i couldn't help but cringe after i saw the way my face looked. i'm a naturally tan person, but when i wore clinique's foundation (i used honey 07) it would make my face look extremely pale and ghostly, compared to the rest of my body. it got to the point where i got so upset that i went back to the clinique counter at macy's and insisted this just couldn't be the right color for me. they insisted it was the correct color and didn't even bother trying new shades on me, even though i had gone back a couple different times. overall, i was really miserable with this product. as a lady, i want to look my best. i definitely don't want to look like someone who doesn't know how to put her makeup on, but whenever i took pictures and saw the way i looked, i couldn't help but think everyone was thinking that. for those of you who may be having my same problem, i recommend switching over to laura mercier. i made the switch and it's been the best makeup decision of my life. my face has never looked better",0
327,this item smells like lemon pine sol. it is not what you think you are paying for. its not worth the money.,0

330,"i have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. i was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. my hair was as dry and frazzled as before i used it. i have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. i recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. and for a mask i tried keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. i really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. maybe i would have had more luck with fekkai's glossers",0
331,"i have been using frederic fekkai's glossing cream for a few years now and love it so i thought i would try the luscious curls.  it was very thick, which may be a good thing since there is so little of it, but doesn't spread through hair very well.  it left my hair a little crunchy, and the crunchiness didn't go away for a few hours.  when it did dry, i felt that my curls just kind of hung there, without much body or shine.  i have used loreal's professional line prior to this and i will definitely go back to it.  it's cheaper, better quality, and twice the size of luscious curls.",0
332,"another disappointed customer. i have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! before using fekkai's luscious curls lotion, i was using aveda's be curly lotion and matrix's curl.life contouring creme. both of the latter products work very well with my hair. i don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so i just air dry it. without blow drying, whether i'm using aveda or matrix, the results are great! my hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.i had never used fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. in fact, it actually made my hair worst! it became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. in addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. also, i didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. it was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.  because of my very poor experience with fekkai's luscious curls lotion, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. i think i'll stick to the aveda and matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair.",0

366,"there are much better products by lush.i got a free sample of this conditioner and used it along with lush's trichomania solid shampoo.  at first i really liked it, but throughout the day, my hair felt like it was getting oilier.  i'm not sure if it was the trichomania or the coolaulin, but i gave both away to my friend who likes coconut.  the smell wasn't my favorite either (i'm not a coconut person), but if you like coconut, you will love the shampoo and the conditioner.as for me, i will stick to american cream and rehab.**update**december 21, 2005i tried the coolaulin conditioner again, and my hair didn't get oily at all.  i'm not sure what happened the first time i tried it, but it was fine this time around.  i'm not a coconut person, so this conditioner is still not my fave (american cream!!), but i do want to add on two stars and make the rating *~*four stars*~* because the conditioner made my hair really soft",0
367,"i found this product did absolutely nothing for me...granted i don't have huge wrinkles, but the few i do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! i wish i had asked around from friends, cause if i had i would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. i'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? and is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that really works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money...",0
368,"i usually enjoy products by philosophy but this stuff is not worth washing the family xolo with, amigo. trust me. this stuff stinks! if a margarita is what you are craving, then stop in at the local don pablo's at lunchtime. not only does this stuff smell bad on the skin, but, as the bottle warns, using this product can cause irritation to the skin and the urinary tract. not good.i will say one good thing about this product: it made the drains in my home smell lime-fresh for days after having poured the entire contents down them.",0
369,"i quickly realized while in the shower that i don't want to smell like a margarita all day.   it does lather well and i don't find the smell to overpowering but it's not that special.   warning to those of us that chemically treat our hair, this product as a shampoo is very drying and strips color out of hair.",0
370,"i can't say enough about philosohpy, but i read another review recomending not to get the mimosa scent because it smells like the tang drink, so i purchased the margarita instead.  i hate to say it, but it is probabloy about the same for this product.  it smells so much like kool-aid that i can't use it. the smell is way to sweet.  i am a big margarita fan, but this smells nothing like it!  just a caution",0
371,"poor quality construction -- the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use.  plus, it was much rougher than something like loofah.  you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that",0
372,"any manufacturer that doesn't fully label their product should not be trusted. i do not see a list of ingredients here (but most nail polishes don't bother to do this anyway). the problem i see is this...this nail polish totes that it's safe to use during pregnancy due to the fact that it doesn't contain the above ingredients, but what does it contain instead? if it wears well, doesn't peel, give good color coverage, it's got to contain something in the offending ingredient's place, logically. please ask yourself this before you sigh relief and add to basket! phthalates, for example, are a class of industrial plasticizers that were invented in the 1930s. they are often used in nail polish because they make nail polish flexible, and they are used in other products because they help bleed the chemicals of fragrances and help lotion better penetrate the skin. they aren't required to be labeled on the products. lab animals given dibutyl phthalate had higher numbers of offspring with birth defects, especially of the male reproductive system. a nail polish may not contain phthalates (and brag about it), but may contain a related plasticizer that essentially is just as harmful. does this contain phthalic anhydride, a toxic chemical hardener? how about fd&c color, such as yellow 5? it's a petroleum-based color that is also questionable when it comes to safety. basically put, no nail polish is safe during pregnancy. on top of that, while your at it you should review every lotion, foundation product, etc that you use if you're concerned about things like this. i think it's great to be careful - more power to you - but be fully informed, not partially. companies prey on our worst fears, and what is worse than harming our babies? if this product is so great, let's see an ingredients list (and all cosmetics should do the same, while i'm sounding off on the subject!)",0
373,"i have to be pretty honest - i was excited to get this kit, but so far i've been disappointed.  maybe i'm not getting the whole technique down, but i find the diagrams pretty generalized and the powder flakes everywhere it isn't supposed to (like under my eyes, making them look very raccoon-y and tired--and when wearing smoky eyes, i figure you probably want everything else to look pretty bright in comparison to the dramatic eye effect).  maybe i can't pull of the look or maybe i'm not applying it correctly, but either way, it always ends up looking like a big, dark, glittery mess...i'm a big bare escentuals lover, but i was disappointed with this product.",0
374,"didn't like this product. all of the actual ""scrub"" (salt) is at the top and minimal.  felt like i would've been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub.  it did smell nice and i like the packaging",0
375,i ordered this march 17th and didnt recieve until april 5th!! it smelled horrible like a weird chalk chemical smell i called lush who said it was probably just a bad batch and to send it back at my own expense ($5) this is after i waited forever to recieve and the product smells horrible..im very mad at lush.com and will not ever order anything from them again except for the angel delight soap..pissedoff,0
376,i was soooo excited to get this in the mail.  i have very oily skin.  the smell is great but the product is messy and my skin looks like i have acne.  i tried it with fresh farmacy and was so disappointed.  the shipping is insanely high.  i will stick to mac skincare from now on,0
377,"i enjoyed using this product because i liked the tingling from the mint - not necessarily a good thing, actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face.  the kaolin and bentonite are drying agents, peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin.  if you separate out the so-called natural ingredients, you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses.  and if it doesn't come straight out of the ground, it ain't natural anymore!  i give it a 2 because i was a sucker for the tingling, not because i saw any improvement in my skin's texture, look, or feel",0
378,"well i dint like the smell at all, i see nothing lovely about this perfum, if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season, check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice, or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have, j.lo's live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present,or for urself its not really worth ur money!",0
379,"and it's called ""narcisso rodriguez"".   buy the nr, you'll like it a whole lot more",0
380,"i have oily & blemish prone skin and i was told by my mother, who used to work for the clinique/estee lauder family, to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non-cosmogenic. this product irritated my skin so much that i just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness. the only reason why i used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working. if it was working, it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than i ever had all at once. not worth your money",0
381,"i don't know why i keep giving clinique a chance.  i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier.  if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away, try clean & clear for oily skin. it's better and cheaper",0
382,"i love trying out new products for my hair and also happen to have slightly thinning hair on the top of my head (with receding corners).  after seeing this set at sephora i tried it for a week and found the results mediocre. my hair, which is thin and not very abundant, did feel slightly thicker and had a plump look at the roots (especially the crown) but i am sensitive to smell and didn't like the man's cologne like scent.  the shampoo lathers up nicely but the conditioner is dense and doesn't spread well over the hair.  the mouse is interesting.  it definitely seems to make a difference in volume.  the overnight liquid makes hair a bit messy to sleep in.  as is the case with any product, it may work for you but it didn't for me.  i believe in changing the body/hair from the inside out works better than rubbing niacin (vitamin b) topically to the scalp and hair.i would recommend you try it.  you can always return it if you're not satisfied",0
383,overpriced for a mediocre soap with a terrible perfume,0
384,"i love clinique products in general, but i don't like the soap in the liquid form ... it has a strong chemical smell to it and i find myself holding my breath while washing my face.  i much prefer the bar soap, and wouldn't buy the liquid again, for all that it seemed much more convenient.  no complaints on cleaning-ability",0
385,both lipsticks were on back order.  i never received either one. please let me know how i can do a survey about 2 items that i never received,0
386,"this product might be better on oily skin with no make-up. the point of it was lost on me. it may create a barrier between treatment products/moisturizer and make-up but it did nothing to perfect my skin. in fact when i touched my face i could feel make-up pilling and rolling off. it has a dry, heavy feeling to it. don't use too much and be careful about dry patches. i thought it would make a better canvas of my skin. i now use laura mercier's primer which goes on light and smooth and gives a healthy glow. i didn't like the formulation of philosophy's product at all",0
387,"i really wanted to like this.  i had heard so much about it and everyone seems to love it.  it smells like sunless tanning lotion on me. i hate that smell.  does it smell like that to anyone else?  oh well, i am disappointed because i really wanted to love it",0
388,"i wanted it to smell good but it just smells so cheap to me. i tried it several times, but it is not amazing. i would not recommend this perfume",0
389,"i normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but i wanted to try something different for a change.  i liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  well...i have to disagree.  i think it is very perfumey and not subtle at all. to me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. i thought at first that maybe i had sprayed too much on, so i tried just a little spritz.  still very strong and sharp. and i agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  i will definitely not be ordering this again.",0
390,"i know this is philosophy's big seller, but i hate the way it smells.  it reminds me of those old ladies that bathe in their fragrance and make everyone around them nauseous.  my husband hated it too, as did my son.i like the comments about it smelling like dead flowers and a dryer sheet.  that is about as close as it gets.if you want a good philosophy scent, go with falling in love, pure grace or philosophy - the scent.  all of them are better than amazing grace.i don't care to smell like a perfumy granny, thank you.  i'll stick with my falling in love",0
391,"i love chocolatei love dark chocolate, especially for my drinking chocolate.i should have been suspicious when on the label it says you can make pudding from this as well...which should have alerted me right off the bat that there are other ingredients in the tin--not just chocolate and some sugar...it must be cornstarch.marie belle makes a big deal of the fact that this is not cocoa, but cacao...that's why i fell for the hype...but in the end, it's the flavor that counts, and this one...i guess because of the corn starch...has a strange ""mouth feel"" and flavor that i find unpleasant.i find the french brand  l'ancienne  far superior...and my favorite drinking chocolate is charbonnell et walker, which is not for sale (yet) on amazon",0
392,"i had trouble rinsing this stuff out; it weighed my hair down, and my hair is dry.  also, my son came up to me and said, ""why does your hair smell so funny?"".  i think it's too conditioning for my hair, and too smelly",0
393,"one of my ""boys"" bought this item for me, and well its ok for the price... its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well... and the scent is extremly light which i dont like, now if they were to make it stronger... this would be a 5 star product",0
394,"i'm going to europe and thought this would save me time in the mornings (and maybe nerves, since i'm traveling with two women and no doubt towels will be in short supply!). but this thing is hard to use, the instructions are poorly drawn, and apparently i have the head of a giant - the button and the button latch (which isn't easy to find and isn't identified in the directions) don't stay together due to my ginormous noggin. the reason i chose this specific product to try was because it was pink and would be clearly different from regular hotel towels and because of the cute tube case - i thought it would pack easily. the material itself seems to work (she says as it slides, yet again, down her forehead to cover her eyes). after twenty minutes of wrestling with this cuddly little critter, i concede. similar items may work, just not this one",0
395,"i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh, clean scent.  i was very disapointed when i used it, as it reminded me of jean nate, which to me is an old lady smell.  it was more musky than clean smelling.  i couldn't smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it.  it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil...that is the only way i can describe it",0
396,"i am dissatisfied with lush's claims that many of its products, like this one, are natural.  i encourage buyers who are looking for products made with natural ingredients to carefully read the ingredients in lush's products.  i have yet to see a lush product that does not contain chemicals of questionable safety.  there are numerous other brands of truly all-natural soaps and shampoos that work excellently",0
397,"as a huge fan of pink sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic, i was ecstatic to try out chocolovers.  since they don't sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided to order it from sephora.com in the us.  first of all i thought the price was fairly reasonable for 1.7oz bottle (a very nice bottle and package, if i might add), it cost me around $50 cdn.  i was so excited when my order came in today that i quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff.  ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment.  i don't know what i had been expecting, maybe something more like milk chocolate, but what i got was a strong citrus/cocoa powder burst fading into a very strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk.  this may sound good, but for as much of a fan of sweet candy/foody smells as i am, i found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick.  right now all i can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat seven up.  on the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets.  i think if i were trying to diet i would wear this scent everyday.  i think i will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because i really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in.  i am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness.  the bottom line is try before you buy",0
398,its cute but it blocks barely any light. lace strap is itchy and uncomfortable.,0
399,"i've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, i find it temperamental. it does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. if you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. now, it turns off while i'm in the middle of doing my hair. the stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as i said, when they work, they're terrific. i'm going to replace mine with another brand",0
400,"it could cover the tattoo, but after while, it fails. not fully invisible",0
401,"if you order this kit, make sure you have time to practice with it!  it takes several practice applications to get the shade just right.  while it does cover completely, it is not flawless. you can tell that you've covered something up on your skin.  if it's not a big deal, you might just want to leave your tattoo visible instead of having a big discolored spot or have someone who is really good with colors and makeup cover it for you with this kit",0
402,"i love philosophy products and own much of the skin care line.  i consider purity facial cleanser a must have.  i was excited to try the hair care line and was so disappointed after using it.  i thought maybe i should give it a good shot and use it a few times to see if it got better with repeated use.  it doesn't.  it is among the worst shampoos i have ever tried.  it's almost worse than the cheapy store bought brands that you use in dire straits.  it instantly left my hair hard and brittle feeling and i couldn't wait to slather the conditioner on.  even after condiditioning, my hair was lifeless and tangled easily!    the poor quality of this product actually made me doubt the entire philsophy line",0
403,"i bought two clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  the trouble started occurring about two months after using.  one brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  the other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!my experience with the customer service has been terrible.  they would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  the warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!",0
404,this fragrance is ok for the teen princesses. this scent doesn't linger and is too subtle. not as nice as vera wang vanity or sheer veil. i don't recommend this unless you are 16 and under. i gave it to my 11 year old and she loves it,0
405,"after having great success with the merkur classic i decided to own up and get the futur.  i was super excited because i thought to myself, ""shoot, one pass instead of two...""  not quite.  for starters the razor is bulking and plain heavy.  and not the kind of heavy i'm comfortable with trying to shave as i shouldn't feel i might drop the darn thing.  i started on 1 the first day to get a handle on the razor.  not a good shave, missed alot of spots and patches of hair.  so day two i went to level 2 on the razor.  same story, second verse.  it left patches and didn't shave well in some areas.  2.5 the areas got smaller but still...they were there.  went to a 3 setting on the razor and almost mangled myself.  so for the next week i went back to a 2.5 and did it more consistantly, still gave me a crappy shave.  i give this one star because if it's supposed to be a better razor than anything before it, there shouldn't be a learning curve from one double edge to another.  at least not one this severe.  i get a way better shave using my merkur classic and i really think at least for me, this is the way to go.  i say use caution on the merkur futur.  i also say if you're already getting a good shave with a double edge you have, don't buy a new style for the sake of buying a new style.  if you're double edge gets old...buy a new one of the same kind.  only a suggestion.",0
406,"did not care for this one really, it is better as a body wash",0
407,"i ordered this for fun and have since decided that it's definitely not for me in any way. it's very drying on my skin, even though it's thick and creamy. the label says it's award-winning, but doesn't state what award it's received (if any!). i fail to see what might warrant it being award-winning. the scent smells like plastic or cheap strawberry candy. also, it's absurdly priced given the quality. i've tried a few philosophy items and need to just stop buying them because i'm always disappointed.",0
408,"i'm with everyone else when they say they were diappointed by this product. i opened this bottle, expecting a totally yummy scent but what i got was nothing like what i expected! when i read that it smelled the nesquick, i thought i'd like it anyway, because i love strawberry nesquick. but this stuff smells like...well, i can't describe it. all i know is i wish i hadn't paid $16 for it. live and learn, i guessperhaps the strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel smells better. off topic, why do they have a strawberry milk shake 3-in-1 gel and a strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel? wouldn't they smell just the same",0

423,"one of my former roommates used to have kerastase nutritive shampoo for very dry hair.  i remember it smelling great and being endorsed by celebrities as the ""it"" shampoo for treating dry, unruly tresses. the other day, i saw this shampoo on the clearance shelf at meijers and regrettably made an impulse purchase.  even at clearance price, this shampoo was still expensive. i have very thick, wavy, and somewhat dry hair that needs lots of conditioning products--when i checked out the ingredients (after i bought the shampoo), i groaned inwardly. almost all of the ingredients (with the exception of water) is on the aubrey organics' ""ingredients to be avoided"" list (that is, they are considered toxic).  like aubrey organics, other reputable natural beauty manufacturers suggest avoiding parabens as preservatives because they are mildly estrogenic and can be absorbed through the skin. this shampoo has six different types of parabens--methyl, ethyl, propyl, etc.     if a product has such a steep asking price, then you would think that its manufacturers would put forth a better formula, incorporating non-toxic, natural ingredients (like aveda, biolage, and biosilk).  at least suave and v05 (bargain-priced shampoos) can boast about having vitamins and silk amino acids in their formulas (though many of their other ingredients are also found on the ""to be avoided"" list).",0

432,this stuff is the worst smelling conditioner i ever encountered.  the perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed.  it took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness.  i wish i could give it a negative rating.  i am glad all i used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink,0

473,"never had i been so unhappy with my makeup as i was when i was using clinique. i used stay beige (which i lightly patted on my face on top of clinique's superfit liquid makeup - i have oily skin and was told this would help reduce the shine) and the end result was that it just made me look ghostly. i also hated how clinique's liquid foundation and powder didn't have matching shades, so that i had to settle for honey in the liquid and beige in the powder. as much as i went back to macy's to try to convince them that these weren't my shades, they just wouldn't listen. either they didn't have the time or the patience to help me pick a new shade, or they were convinced i was making a big deal out of nothing. instead of sitting there and arguing with them (which i shouldn't have to do in the first place) i just switched to a different makeup line: laura mercier, which i am very happy with.i've had many other friends who were unhappy with clinique and switched over to a different makeup brand, as well. i'm not trying to knock the product. i'm just saying it wasn't for me or for many of the other people i know. i would definitely not recommend clinique to anyone. i'd rather pay a little more and get better results rather than settle for a $20 product just because it's affordable.",0

481,what's the point of this mascara when half the container doesn't do what it's supposed to do? the black mascara is not good quality--it comes off very quickly. part of the problem may be that the brush is simply too tiny--larger brushes are far superior when it comes to applying mascara. and the silver stuff--the only reason someone would seek out this product--is all but invisible on the lashes regardless of how many times you go over your lashes with the wand.,0

503,"i bought the entire line of products from the lisa's hair regimen on the carol's daughter website. i took all the products back to sephora yesterday. i used this hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. i washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. i wear my hair natural and i had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. when i took the product back to sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was red w/ white spots all throughout it. i had to take otc pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. the only thing i can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. the product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. if you have allergies to these items i would suggest not using this product. i contacted carol's daughter and have not heard back from them yet. i would have expected more from the company who's product states 'made with love, peace'.",0
504,i just received my conditioner today and it's going back to sephora. i don't know how this can be called a conditioner because it's nothing more than water. it also smells nothing like vanilla. the only scent i could smell was coconut and i don't want my hair smelling like that,0
505,"ok, so this is the 2nd philosophy product that i've tried and felt the need to write a review on. i have to say, this product is far below expectations. i sprayed in on, and the only thing you smell is the alcohol. there seems to be no other notes to it, even after you let it settle, all you can pick up is alcohol. definitely not recommending this product.",0
506,i bought this for travel/gym bag use. when it arrived i opened all bottles and sniffed. the frangrace was very masculine smelling. i guess this is the yerba mate aroma which is very earthy smelling,0
507,"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0
508,"i love, love, love, lipglass normally.  but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.",0
509,"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",0
510,"this stuff is supposed to help razor burn, ingrown hairs. honestly after all the time using it i can't honestly say if it works. what i can say is that it smells terrible. not a weak terrible smell, but a strong, overpowering stink.it also burns like crazy when you put it on.the tend skin company puts out this story about a miraculous discovery - a dentists patient came to him after a tooth extraction and raved that whatever the anesthetic was that he was given, it had cured his ingrown hairs.well, there are three ingredients in tend skin - alcohol, glycerin, and aspirin. thats it.so apparently this dental patient had been cured of ingrown hairs by taking an aspirin.bottom line is, this product is insanely overpriced, and they hide it with this distortion, this silly propaganda about its ""miraculous discovery.""a little bottle of alcohol and aspirin should cost a tenth of this",0
511,"i bought this stuff because i heard it helped with razor burn. my husband likes me to shave a bit more often than i liked, well, too bad for him!! the pain from putting this stuff on was way worse than any sort of razor burn! no thanks!",0
512,"i have always had problems with razor burn and shaving issues overall.  it used to be a disaster and i was introduced and used tend skin for the past two or three years now.  i got a sample of solution 2 out in the hamptons last weekend and i could not possibly be happier.  it is a significant improvement over tend skin--the roller ball applicator is brilliant and i have officially (thankfully) pitched my cotton ball bag.  it does not sting nearly as much as tend skin.  it smells so much better (actually pretty good!) and it works better too.  i used to get very dry patches on my neck from using tend skin but i have had no dryness issues with solution 2.  i used to have a strict regimen using tend skin in order to get through my shaving procedure.  now, i roll on the solution 2 and it's all good:)",0
513,i really do not feel tend skin works as advertised. the irritation to my neck persisted and if anything had only gotten worse after applying as instructed. one good thing is that you if you are like me and have trouble waking up in the morning --- tend skin helps for that! just take a strong whiff and you'll be alert and ready for your day!,0
514,"i used to use tend skin. it works ok, but there are better things out there now. tend skin is an outdated product...like the sytptic pencil. tend skin stings, smells like pure alcohol and there is lots of wasted product because it is easy to spill. i recently switched to min solution2 like it much better than tend skin. min solution2 has a roller application (no waste), organic spearmint (fresh smell) and doesn't burn like tend skin.",0
515,"i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this ""jokeoil"" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all",0
516,"this mascara works great; it lengthens, separates, and defines your lashes and it doesn't smudge, but it's so hard to take off!  i used lancome's bi-facil makeup remover, which is designed to remove waterproof mascara, but it was still hard to remove.  i lost quite a few lashes in the process.  i would recommend buying the regular definicils, not the waterproof",0
517,"i love these products however, this particular candle does not have the same, intense scent as previous candles i've purchase",0
518,"after reading the great reviews of the votivo candles i decided to spend the rediculous sum of $24 on a moroccan spice candle.when i received the candle i smelled sweet spice coming from it even before i opened the packaging.readying myself for a rocket of rich fragrance immersing my room in exotic spice i hopefully lit the candle.after about an hour of the candle being lit i came into my room and it scented only about 3 feet around the candle.dissapointed, and perhaps to prove that there was absolutely no way i didn't get jacked on this purchase i lit it again-this time for 3 hours.there was still no smell.compare this with the $6 'tea' candles i bought from the gold canyon candle co. which when i lit 6 of them richly scented not only my room (which is about 13' 13') but the hallway, as well as my mothers room next door (16' 16')!if your thinking that maybe the $22+ dollars would be worth it for the exotic fragrances-think again as there was nothing special about the scent that you couldn't get from the grocery store. jipped-you bet",0
519,"i should have listen to the reviewer who said it smelled like ""lemon pledge""...it really has a chemical smell and not pleasant at all.  i'm going to use it at the office to spray down the supply room",0
520,"this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over.  it was terribly strong and just not quite what i wanted.  the company did promptly give me a refund though.  i suggest you try out ""demeter fragrances.""  they are more natural smelling",0
521,this product is no better than any regular washcloth and/or headband to hold your hair back. save your money,0
522,"i have tried the lush products and found them kinda good but then my friend introduced me to the melt product line. any benefits i thought i was getting from lush... out the window. their products seemed, all the sudden, unimpressive. and i really like that melt is denver based! try them out and see what you think for yourself (if you aren't here in colorado i know they have online products too) and make your own choice. i recomend them though and i have told everyone i know to switch! :-",0
523,"like the fresh farmacy, i bought this soap based on the reviews and ended up giving it to a friend at work.  don't get me wrong, i love most of lush's products and, to my husbands chagrin, end up spending a lot of money on their online products but when i got this particular soap i just couldn't get into it.  i admit that it smelled a bit better after showering with it for the first time but still found myself reaching for my ""sexy peel"" over this stuff.  i ended up giving it to a friend that i work with but only after it had been passed over my three other girls in my office...i'm just not getting the ""heavenly scent"" that this item was described as having in previous reviews",0
524,"this product didn't work for me, as described. first of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! smells lemony! its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue. that was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. in fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats i use. i also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but i've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when i woke up and i let them dry for a few hours after painting them! i wouldn't recommend this product.",0
525,"when i got this candle i was very excited, but when i lit it, it seemed to make a scent that strongly smelled of fart. when i put it out, the fart smell went away",0
526,"i bought this for my wife for the holidays, it was a bit expensive for a candle but i believed that it would last a long time and burn uniformly. however, in our case, after about an hour the candle went out. the wick burned too quickly, becoming too small, and now the candle won't stay lit for more than a few minutes before it drowns in the wax. the return shipping will cost a lot, so we will just toss it out. waste of money, don't buy one",0

529,"if you're really looking forward to brightening your blonde, go to the salon and ask for a non-ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product.  chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color.  the expense of this product is not justified by the results, and while lush likes to toot its horn about being ""natural"", that designation could apply to arsenic.  it's pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives - the parabens",0

531,"this brush was not as firm as expected.  i expected greater quality from the sephora brand.  however, the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to ""finer"" brushes.  so in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more",0

534,"this shampoo is just awful. it's greasy and it's made up of a 90/10 ratio, 90 being oil and 10 being soap. smells great but leaves your hairl slimy and gross",0
535,"maybe my expectations were too high due to the hype surrounding these products.  however, this shampoo did not work for me.  like the previous reviewer said, it was watery and did not lather at all.  it also made my hair feel stripped and left it very hard.  i followed up with a hair smoothie, but a large amount of my hair broke off due to how dry and unmanageable the product left my hair.  i do not recommend this at all",0
536,"this shampoo is so bad that i thought perhaps the wrong product had been put into a shampoo bottle by mistake. it is watery and does not lather. my hair felt like it hadn't been washed for days, and the next day i had to use a different shampoo to get rid of the film. i never write reviews but felt this might save someone from wasting $10.00",0
537,all i can say is do not buy this [...].  i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time.  it smells horrible.  it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it.  i had to wash my hair (with a different product of course) at least 6 times to get it back to normal again...........what a complete rip off!!!,0
538,"i received two sizeable chunks of karma soap in a couple of my orders and i thought i'd give it a go.  eeeep - there's a whole bunch of patchouli in there (which i hate, but still thought i should at least try).  maybe i'm overly sensitive to the patchouli but it was so strong.  the soap as a whole smelled like a sickening mix of syrup-y orange soda mixed with that dreaded patchouli.  to be fair though, you can smell different elements in it and appreciate it for that.  aside from this, this soap melts incredibly fast.  even if you keep it in a draining soap dish, even if you take it completely out of the shower, away from the steam,  it still melts at an alarming rate!i can see how people (who love herbal scents) would like this.  it is a unique scent that has depth and layers to it,  but it's just not for me",0
539,"i have glorious white hair, and i thought this would be good for it.  but it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly i don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of suave that's out there. i've also used lush's big shampoo and soak 'n' float shampoo bars, and i like them much better.",0
540,"i have to agree with another reviewer. this product is not worth the price tag. it claims to have a vanilla scent, and it does, but it is barely noticible. don't buy this product based on how it smells. as a moisturizer, you can do much better for $23.00.",0
541,the shipping was very slow and the product really isn't worth $23 with shipping for an 11 oz jar.  the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin.  then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin.  overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted.  i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer.,0

544,"i read about bobbi brown tinited moisturizer as a recommendation in a magazine and decided to try it.  i went to saks and the saleswoman ""made up my face"" using the moisturizer.  i thought i liked the look in the store and felt the coverage stayed on all day during my shopping.  however, the next day when i applied the moisturizer alone without all the other products i discovered i didn't like it.  it went on and immediately the product seemed to sink into the pores of my skin and also seemed cakey.  i am going to return this product and the concealer that i bought as well.  this product just doesn't apply very smoothly.  i think i will try the laura mercier tinted moisturizer that everyone is raving about instead",0
545,"as rosey as this oils smells, it just isn't as good as the real thing.  being a fragrance oil, it has no medicinal properties.  i certainly wouldn't use it on my skin, or in a bath!  thanks, but no thanks.  you definitely get what you pay for",0

549,"i was very excited to receive this product,yet my enthusiasm quickly turned to confusion.call me foolish,but i thought perfume was to have a sweet,pleasant aroma{?. this pot had the distinct scent of a citronella {skeeter} candle...like the one i could smell burning from my neighbors yard last summer!!!! i kept applying and re-applying it to ""get a smell"" from it...not much luck. maybe the spray perfume smells far better??? i do not understand how the founder says this perfume gets so many compliments!how? if i rubbed the bug candle wax on my wrists, i would not have gals clammoring around me asking me what i was wearing!!!!i wore this a few times just to see the reactions.....only 1 person said they could ""sota"" smell something! i tried paris hilton, and britney's fantasy, and got tons of compliments! buy at your own discretion",0

551,"falling in love is one of my favorite scents ever.  it's basically my go-to fragrance for everyday.  if you're a fan of this scent you already know it's really pretty but very light.  that's why i was exited about the solid for touch-ups on the go.  let me tell you, subtle is an understatement for this product. when i opened the seal and held it under my nose i could hardly smell it.  when i applied it (generously) to my wrist the scent was barely detectable.  i rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn't help at all.  i expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice.  very disappointing.",0

554,"i was looking forward to a lovely lavender scent when i got this soap,  but sadly, that's not what happened.  the smell is a very strong herbal;  like the kind you would add to an italian pasta dish.   not very appealing!  there is some complexity to the scent, but it's so overshadowed by the herb smell to really come through.  on the plus side,  the color is beautiful (a rich, dark purple) and the lather is equally lovely to look at.  if you like true herbal scents, then you should give this a try.  it just wasn't for me.",0

(bumble and bumble styling spray is another amazing product for great flat ironing results.)i forked out $60 to try phtyo2 after reading all the rave reviews.  i am satisfied with the outcome but not blown away.  yes, phyto2 did not smell bad, it did not burn my scalp and it did straighten my hair but no better than dark and lovely or tcb, and my hair was still hard and stiff afterward.it has been several weeks and my hair is doing great, but again no different from when i use dark & lovely.  i guess i am lucky that my hair responds well to any type of relaxer so i doubt i'll be spending another $60 for phyto2...i'd rather buy two tubes of phytodefrisant balm and continue to with my $7.99 drug store brands.  i hope this helps someone with similar hair as mine.  if you do well with drug store brands, phyto results are not that different...spend the money on their other products that nourish and condition your hair",0
575,okay but does not keep cool for long. i do like the massage effect from the beads,0
576,"the instructions say, ""use whenever your skin needs a boost.""  it goes on to imply that you will see a result every time you use it - it's not one of these products where you need to use it repeatedly to see results.  i bought it at a big upscale department store and used it that night.  now that winter is approaching, my skin gets a little wacky at times.the product comes out as a gel but becomes creamy as you apply it on the damp skin.  the instructions are to leave it on until a ""full froth"" forms (approximately 5 minutes), then rinse off.the cream began to take on the consistency of foam after about 2 minutes, and at the end of 5 minutes the foam was beginning to dissipate and leave big empty patches on my skin, so i rinsed it off.  my skin didn't look any different when done.  it didn't feel any different when done.  for $52 i expected at least some type of visible change - even if it made my skin redder, or plumper, or something.unfortunately the box is now in the bottom of the trash, so i can't return it.  we have christmas guests coming; maybe one of them will enjoy using it",0
577,"i bought the entire line of products from the lisa's hair regimen on the carol's daughter website. i took all the products back to sephora yesterday. i used this hair oil on my scalp and the next day my scalp started itching. i washed it that night and woke up the next morning in serious pain. i wear my hair natural and i had what felt like chemical burns all over my scalp. when i took the product back to sephora the lady who sold it to me told me my scalp was red w/ white spots all throughout it. i had to take otc pain medication twice a day for three days just to help me sleep at night due to the pain. the only thing i can attribute it to is an allergic reaction. the product contain extracts from different types of plant and flowers. if you have allergies to these items i would suggest not using this product. i contacted carol's daughter and have not heard back from them yet. i would have expected more from the company who's product states 'made with love, peace'.",0
578,"until a couple of years ago this used to be the gold standard of leave-ins:  it made my dry, curly hair soft, shiny, and smelling great!  but lately something has changed. the once thick, silky liquid has turned thin and watery, with a distinctly alcohol-like smell.  it's so disappointing... this product has gone from 5 to 2 stars in my book.  don't bother with it anymore, unless the original formula comes back",0
579,"in all honesty, i'd rate the fragrance itself as ""5 stars,"" however, the scent does not last for love nor money, which is why i give it a mere ""1 star.""  you'll find that you have to continuously apply it in order for anyone to compliment you on it and, consequently, before you know it, you've depleted your perfume!  talk to anyone who has worn or even sells this fragrance and, if they're honest, they will tell you exactly what i've written here.  because i adore the scent, i'm going to try the baby phat goddess body lotion and see if that has a lingering effect",0
580,"ive had this product for the past 2 weeks and it does not do what it claims to do, i still have to reapply makeup and it still smudges of",0
581,"i think this product would be great, but wasn't able to use it becasue the description of it on this website and on phiolosphy's website does't give you one tiny bit of information.  the very last step, the very last sentence says that you shouldn't use this product if you are prone to breakouts because this will cause a severe breakout.  the reason i bought this was to clear up my face, so it would have been nice to know this before i am about to apply it to my skin",0
582,"this didn't do anything for me. is it supposed to have very subtle cumulative effect? i am returning it. i'm really surprised others had such great results, because i tried it twice and left it on for double the time, and still it did nothing more than wash my face and maybe moisturize with the cream. it does have more than baking soda and h2o2- also contains catalase, some stearic acid, and some vitamin c. of course, your skin already has its own catalase.",0
583,this is very expensive for what is essentially hydrogen peroxide and baking soda. which would cost the average person about 3 dollars.,0
584,"i've read so many positive reviews about this and i wanted to buy it so very much. but when i got around to actually smell it...i was so dissapointed, i can only smell an old lady perfume, a bug spray, i don't know, something so strong and not strong in the right way. my favourites are dior j'adore, red delicious, intuition( estee lauder), try them instead if you want to feel sexy and powerful",0
585,"small, thin, fragile, not worth the five dollars.  find a better product from another company",0
586,i got my bottle of curve today and tried it out...  my girlfriend said i smelled like dust.  oops!  too bad they don't have scratch and sniff on the computer..,0
587,"ok ive been using proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. people often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice.one night i styed up late and that murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.couple of days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again. i have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. my main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before",0
588,the product has made my skin much worse than when i started. i am so sorry i  even kept at it!! :(  how can i reverse all the damage now that murad has given me. :*,0
589,"i purchased the murad acne complex for $40 or so (for a measley one month supply).  i was disgustingly excited to try it, as everything else has failed me.  proactiv works wonderfully for me, but only for the first month or two, then it seems i grow an immunity to it.i paid to have the murad acne complex expedited to me because i was so anxious to get on to 'beautiful, clear skin.'  i read the pamphlet, and understood that my skin could go through a ""purging"" phase, where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants.  imagine the worst skin you've ever seen.  imagine the most painful breakouts.  that was my personal ""purging"" process.  it was literally the worst breakout of my entire life.  my husband kept telling me to continue using the products though, because this was expected.  i'm still using the products, and though my skin is better than it was 3 weeks ago, i'm basically back where i was when i started.  i give up.  but i'm not giving up any more money to murad",0
590,this dryed my skin out really bad and it didn't even work.dont use this,0
591,"like the others i was disappointed after a couple times using this product.  and like the others i started to breakout where i had not broken out before, on my forehead etc.  i bought this product because i had problem areas.  using this product brought out more problem areas and dried out my skin.  i used the product as prescribed. the commercial said it was gentle and what made this product different from the rest was that it wouldn't cause acne only with it's ""gentle"" formula help it with immediate results.  not true at all.  this is just like any other product on the market for acne.  if you have the weeks of pain and suffering and embarrassing breakouts more than what you had before to get results, this is the product for you.  i, on the other hand, couldn't deal with the additional embarrassment of my skin getting worse before it got better.  when my trouble areas weren't that bad in the first place.not recommended as they advertise.  they aren't different than the others.  proactive does the same thing.",0
592,"this product should be listed only for people with really oily skin.  it dried my combination skin out so bad that it got red, flaky, and it hurt!  i also got horrible pimples all over my face due to over drying.  this is actually harsher than proactive.. unless your skin covered in oil,  it probably wont be able to handle it.  good luck getting your refund, i'm still waiting for mine.  i also cancelled the shipments twice and they keep charging me and sending them",0
593,"i first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. i fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. i decided when i had some extra cash i would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for christmas. christmas came and went and no fantasy, instead i recieved celine dion's fragrance. i liked the smell of the dion but was still sad that i didn't get what i wanted. i decided to buy the fantasy for myself. upon finding it at a makeup counter i became rather thankful i got the other. i think fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray i had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. the bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. it'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should i be surprised? i suppose the scent caters well to spears' followers, 12 year olds",0
594,i really wanted to like this one but just couldn't get past the smell.   it was really over-powering.  lush makes some really lovely smelling soaps but this isn't one of them.  i didn't find it drying though and it did lather very nicely.  it was just too strongly scented for my liking,0
595,"i didn't know you were supposed to peel that waxy rubbery black stuff off the soap...i normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good, i had to try it.  i ended up covered with black, waxy streaks all over my body when i got out of the shower!  they didn't rinse off, either.  the only thing that seemed to work was to rub really vigorously with a towel...i still had black smudges and a wax residue.  once i figured out how to take a knife to the coating, i had a better opinion of the soap, except that it pretty much cut the soap in half.  it smelled really nice, but i don't think i would get this again.",0
596,"i generally love lush soaps, but do not recommend this one. demon in the dark has a great name, but it doesn't smell very good (a sort of faint, slightly minty scent). it also has a black wax coating that is rather difficult to peel or scrape off, but must be removed for the soap to work properly.  i would try red rooster or karma soap instead",0
597,"i'm in my 30's, light skin, everybody was talking about this product so i decided to give it a try; didn't work for me, after using it for a while i had break outs and my skin became greasy. it's not what they say it is, i've tried many philosophy products the only one that is what they promised is amazing grace for your body, but the skin care products are a scam, go for neutrogena or clinique , good luc",0
598,"ick.  i bought ultra light kirsch because i thought it would be similar to a discontinued grapey color that i used to love by loreal.smell - fake grade-school grape-aid smell grossed me out.feel - i like lip gloss that feels glossy.  this stuff did not shine enough or last long enough.color - the color was to mild for me.  i was very disappointed.  i felt like i had wasted money and time. i still recommend loreal lip juice, though. i believe it's the same company, and lip juice is glossy, shiny, long-lasting and way more cost-effective",0
599,"i had very high hopes for this cream, as it appears they went the extra mile for quality. not so. the cream when used leaves alot of friction as the razor goes over your face, making for some tense moments that should not be there.i have used many creams. so far art of shaving is the best. casswell massey is ok as is aveda. avoid truefitt.update. trufitt and hill accepted the return and we spoke about the problems. they sent me a new updated extra fine version that should be available to the public now that is of the same quality as massey. it is good. the standard is still substandard",0
600,"i thought the product arrived in a timely manner.  the instructions were clear, but it's hard to hold the stencils and put on your eyebrow at the same time.  not a bad product for the price",0
601,"i received this as a christmas gift and loved the smell of it.  after my second time using it, i broke out in a terrible itchy rash. there is a warning on the bottle that it may cause skin and urinary tract irritation.  do not buy it if you have even mildly sensitive skin.  the smell is great, but is gone after you get out of the shower.",0
602,"i just used this product in a bath. it's supposed to be a cinnamon smelling bubble bath, shampoo rinse, shower gel. well first of all, i almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon, this is really weak smelling. (i am a real scent meister too.) i used it as a bubble bath, guess what? the bubbles were gone within minutes. stick with the avon bubble bath, it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done! then i used it as a shampoo. guess what? it didn't lather! i ended up using the trusty suave to finish the bath. very disapointing product! i bought the 32oz. for myself as a christmas present, can't wait till it's gone",0
603,"i have worked with two women who have worn this perfume, and frankly, i can't stand the smell of it. it doesn't even smell like perfume, it is like some bizarre animal musk. there are no floral notes, and no woodsy notes, either; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant. i wish this perfume didn't exist---i hate it.",0
604,i had such high hopes for this product. i thought it was going to be the perfect scent for me. as it turns out that couldn't be futher from the truth. it smells like cheap old lady perfume. yuck. to top it all off they raised the price of it by 5 dollars!! talk about inflation. ouch!,0
605,"when i think of an almond cookie, i think of something sweet, especially given the description of this product.  the smell of almond is so overpowering, its all i can smell.  i didn't catch vanilla or sandalwood.  i've already returned my products",0
606,i ordered this item. all of your information indicated that it was in stock. the company shipped another product instead. the mirror i wanted was out of stock. i never received any information so i ended up paying more from another vendor and still didn't have the mirror for christmas. i am so disappointed with amazon and bebeautiful,0
607,i have thick coarse hair and was looking for something to make it softer.  i used just a little bit and it was really greasy.  i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum.  it works much better,0
608,"i wouldn't recommend this product to a person with long hair like myself. after using this so called ""instant detangler"" my hair was more tangled then ever. in my opinion any cheap hair conditioner from a drug store will do a better job",0
609,"i was very unhappy with this product. first the shipping took way too long. second, the tube is much smaller than sold at macy's and the cost is more. and the contents were gross, very goopy. not smooth. like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. i'll fight the mall to buy this next time",0
610,"i love, love, love, lipglass normally.  but this shade is terrible unless you want to look like a bad go-go dancer.",0
611,"my sister-in-law bought this product for me after i had admired the shade (purr, a light baby pink color) that she was wearing. i have used other mac products before with great results, but was very dissapointed with this product. first of all, i gave this product one star because the shade does look very pretty on the lips and went very well with my skin coloring. however, this product is sticky. very sticky! it does not matter whether you apply a lot or very little, you still wind up with this horrible heavy feeling on your lips. not only is it sticky, but just down right uncomfortable. when i wear a lip gloss, i want to be soft and smooth feeling. i want to be able to rub my lips together without them getting stuck together and 'dragging' so to speak. also, because of this gloss' consistancy, it has a tendency to clump together on your lips and form a line of 'gunk' on both the upper and lower lip where the two meet and rest together when you have your moth closed. this will start to happen only about 15 minnutes after application. very embarassing when you have been talking to some hot guy and then look in the mirror afterwards to discover you have gross lines on your lips!!!!  this product seems to be popular with other viewers, however, i would never reccomend this to anyone",0
612,"this product will claim to be on the same level of the tools that dermatologists use to extract blackheads.  but don't count on any instructions included to tell you how to use this little rod. i did some searching on the internet for a clue, and all directions simply said you press the loop firmly against the blackhead to extract the comedones.  well that left a red circle on my face and made tears come out of my eyes ...but left the blackhead firmly in place.if there is a better way to use this tool i highly doubt it will produce effective results.  there is simply nothing unique or different about the little metal loops than the end of your fingers.  don't waste your money on this pathetic product",0
613,"it only takes a little bit of reading to realize that abrading the skin with a piece of metal is not the solution for ending blackheads/enlarged pores. using this ""extractor"" is equal to using one's fingers to squeeze out imperfections, which may produce very temporary results, but is ultimately fruitless. those who feel a need to purchase this device should invest in professional deep-cleaning instead, which will rid the skin of excess oil and help the pores to close without aggravation",0

631,"i think i may have had a bad batch because when i read the reviews on how yummy it had smelled, made me curious. so, i tried it and i hated it! the smell of it turned my stomach. it did soften my hair a bit, but i don't recommend using it again. sorry lush",0
632,"let me just say that i have thick, dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp. and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess. it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage. the smell was really good at first, very coconuty. but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent, like playdoh and pepper. so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap. it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars",0

635,this stuff has great shine. but it dries my lips and it starts peeling. and uber sticky,0
636,"at first it smells very sharp and citrusy, almost like men's cologne. then few seconds later it mellows out a bit and smells somewhat herbal. after 15 minutes you won't be able to smell it at all. very hyped up mediocre perfume with very steep price tag. you'd be better off buying a bottle of herbal essence shower gel and getting identical results",0
637,"i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. it did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. it stinks so bad, i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down...i had to give her a bath, it was so bad",0

639,"i got this bar based on the other reviews, and boy, is it strong! the bar will last a very good long while, unless you can actually stomach the smell of gallons of patchouli without getting a major headache. patchouli was originally supposed to be a base scent for other sweeter scents to sit upon. it was never supposed to be a stand-alone perfume! like all the lush bubble bars, this definitely packs the bubbles in a small amount. i just have buyers remorse because i now have this oversized bar (and it is a very big bar), and i can only use bits of it when my fiance is out of town because he gets an allergic reaction to the strong strong strong smell. i think the upside is that it seems like the scent isn't nearly so strong once you're actually *in* the bath. or maybe by then your olfactory senses are so overwhelmed you just can't tell the difference anymore.so yeah, if you love love loooooooove patchouli, then this is truly the bath bar for you. otherwise, i'd steer clear and go for something gentler. the hot milk bubble bar is the opposite of this bar, in that it's really gentle on the nose. and any of the jasmine flavored products would also be a better recommendation than this one.i love lush, but not this bar",0

646,"the fatalistic view of conservativism is expressed by kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, ""[edmund] burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which providence has prepared man"".  but wait. the conservative mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of america with ward and june cleaver and normal rockwell. meanwhile, burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. what a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.there are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. kirk writes, ""what men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well"" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. the author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. is it so surprising that kirk lauds some of the worst racists in american history like nathanial bedford forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? in a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate john c. calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises john randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. kirk goes on about calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the fugitive slave act which forced federal officials and law officials in northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. he supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. for calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. one wonders if kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. the duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. quoting samuel coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. sounding like the inspiration for disgraced chief justice roy moore, russell kirk urges that, ""state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law"". kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of god but never draws a distinction. i have to wonder if, like the modern reconstructionist, kirk wanted to see the laws of leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. he never explains how one might recognize a law of god besides using prejudice.the third thread would be kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. he refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of god in prejudice and tradition. `prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for god and those in higher stations and authority.in order to grab the golden fleece of populism conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. like calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete. i found russell kirk's salesmanship of conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day.",0

734,"""the number"" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. a four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? the proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. eisenberg, a former esquire editor and short-timer with lands end, ruminates about a simple question: how much money do you need to feel secure? the problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. and the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. doctors, divorcees, `downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. maybe i knew too much going in. maybe i expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. in the middle i was confused. by the end i was simply disappointed. and i have my own number, and it changes every day",0
735,"the author is a journalist, but he seems straight out of the chamber of commerce or a right-wing think tank. like business elites, the author basically does not particularly like democracy. in his view societies should be run by elites from several areas - even authoritarians if needed. he is a proponent of constitutional liberalism, based on laws, rights, especially property rights, separation of powers, with much of that power being held in unelected bodies, and most of all free-market capitalism. he finds that set of conditions to be far more important than the exercise of democracy. his low regard for democracy is easily seen in his minimal interest in the manner in which a society of laws is created or even its exact nature and who benefits. most in the west do care. rights and legal systems are not neutral: the manner of construction determines relative winners and empowerment. though the author's real target is us society, he looks at the results of democracy over the world. and of course, he finds plenty of examples where democracy doesn't work. a country in the grip of fanatics will invariably elect and support leaders who are little concerned with rights and legalisms. but it is ridiculous to imply that those situations have any bearing on democracy in the us. in the us, the author is most concerned with what he calls the democratization of society over the last fifty or so years. in actuality, he is focusing on mass culture that is spread through mass consumption as vigorously promulgated by globalizing capitalism. in this era, elites in finance, business, law, banking, health care, various media, etc have likewise been swept up, in fact are the driving force, in a money-first culture. he contends that such elites once had an ethos of service and basically kept our democracy on track via subtle pressures on the masses. it is simply a cynical misrepresentation to hold that massive shopping at wal-mart and the like represents democratic empowerment. the actual test of democracy would be the ability of a community to stop the wal-mart juggernaut. he especially decries direct citizen actions. he is correct to observe that referenda and initiatives have had unintended consequences, often being usurped by special interests with deep pockets. however, he little notes that citizens have taken those routes due to the unresponsiveness of legislative processes. it's hard to take seriously the stance that the robber barons of the late 19th century, and their heirs, should be viewed as elites who kept our democracy on course, after bribing entire state legislatures as well as members of congress to accumulate vast sums. if citizens had actually been democratically empowered, such distortions of the political process could have been prevented. the theme that cash sanitizes crooks is as american as apple pie. his view that such unelected bodies as the supreme court and the federal reserve board prevent illiberal democracy is also questionable. who could be unaware of the politicization of those bodies: the embarrassing handling of the presidential election of 2000 or the cheerleading role of the fed during the stock market bubble of the late 1990s benefiting financial elites? no, rule by elites has very frequency distorted and usurped democracy, not buttressed it. if the author put journalism first, instead of being an apologist for 21st century capitalism, he would note the death grip that corporations now have over our society and the political process, actually foiling democracy. first and foremost that control is solidified through the mass media and the education system, distorting and muting all challenging ideas. it is not surprising that americans have been unable to mount any significant challenge to this latest version of laissez-faire, free-market capitalism that is involved in such harmful developments as free-trade agreements, worker visa programs, massive immigration, out-of-control energy policies, broken health care systems, huge cutbacks in various safety net programs, massive redistribution of wealth upwards, the gutting of our manufacturing base, etc. the list could go on. informed, empowered citizens would not permit this system of corporate rule to exist. the us most decidedly is not in a state of too much democracy, but is in the throes of democratic failure, which election hoopla very conveniently disguises periodically. this is the story of democracy that the author chooses to ignore. it is surprising to see the fairly high ratings of this book. americans are supposedly fiercely democratic. yet here is a book that clearly advocates elite rule, even anti-democratic generals if need be. the book is really worth reading only to see the willingness of some to contain citizen empowerment.",0

737,"the author makes a couple of valuable points. first, any long-term investment strategy has to take into account the existence of recurrent ""secular"" (i.e., indefinitely long) bear markets. most leading investment advisors recommend a ""buy and hold"" strategy, but this only works during predominately bull market periods. most studies of successful investment strategies are biased towards the recent 1982-1999 bull market, which is anomalous in historical terms. the author uses a plethora of graphs and charts to prove that ""buy and hold"" doesn't always provide the best returns. obviously, then, it's better to pull out during the bear markets, but that's easier said than done. the author provides a very complete analysis of the characteristics of bear markets, including p/e ratio, interest and inflation rates, and gdp. the problem is that those characteristics don't always correlate with market performance. for example, this book was written in 2004 and the author predicted a bear market. well, if you heeded his advice, you would have missed the bull market of 2004, 2005 and early 2006, especially in small-mid caps and foreign stocks. even with high p/e ratios, a bull market can continue for several years: witness the late 90s. it's virtually impossible to time the market even if you monitor the major stock indexes on a daily basis. there is so much volatility on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis that's it's impossible to know when the market has switched directions. by the time that it is apparent, it's too late to profit. even in the midst of great bull markets, there might be week, month, or even year-long downturns. the author says nothing about individual stock picking, beyond a general value approach. the book is all about big picture, long term trends. another problem is that the author's predictions are based on his analysis of market trends going back to 1900. but the market (and economy) is a different beast now that it was in the 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s. as they say, past performance does not predict future returns. the investment advice provided here is not useful. he suggests a ""portfolio of hedge funds,"" ignoring the fact that most hedge funds require a minimum deposit of 500k. he also recommends a ""bond ladder,"" an approach which can be easily replicated with a good bond mutual fund, and frequent rebalancing of your portfolio asset allocations. i don't need to spend $25 and five hours reading to learn that!one thing i did learn from this book is the impact of volatility, which is often ignored in investment strategy recommendations. volatility cuts into returns in ways that most studies do not account for. most studies just average the returns across years, but that doesn't reflect real returns. let's say you invest $100k into a stock that returns 35% the first year and -15% the second. your average return should be 10% a year, right? wrong. at the end of the first year you have 135k. minus 15% the second year leaves you with 115k total, equal to 7% a year compounded. if you had received 10% a year compounded, your final total would be over 121k. that's 6k difference in just 2 years, and the volatility costs add up.the book is very poorly written, plodding, sooooo boring, with tons of repetition. just as an example, the graph showing the ""y curve"" relationship between p/e ratio and inflation is repeated no less than 3 times.",0

740,"the amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives.  i had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948.  i am not questioning mosley's portrayal of racism.  however, i did a little research into just how violent place los angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very.  there may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but l.a. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827!  mosley may have been more familiar with l.a. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.  throw in speakeasies, gangsters hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928.i am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate.  but many, many people hail mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before.  from what i can tell, he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (i guess those years average to be about 1948).  mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation.  however, i doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic, and i hope readers realize that it is not.easy rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak, but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting.  a detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.  detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via  confession.  easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about everything he ""solves"" is simply confessed to him.  i find that extremely dissatisfying.mosley has packed the book with violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.  none of the fights are well described.  easy, for being a self-professed ""killing machine"" can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them.  they are either big or they are small.  he does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic braggartmosley does show signs of being a very good writer.  but i think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional.  i imagine that his work must have improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over.  and again, i don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel.",0
741,"i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel. one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d. macdonald style just because that's what film-going audiences like. i do not think this is a bad thing, but i, like some of the reviewers here, are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i.e., macdonald's &quot;cape fear,&quot; or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof. as for her writing style, she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown. what we're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents, davy, his fiancee, and to some extent, lani, who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman. her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged. the men in this novel just weren't credible when they spoke. i kept seeing jance speaking for them. so we're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker. what's the tohono o'otham word for &quot;2 thumbs down?&quot",0

757,"a generation before there was a left behind, there was the late great planet earth by hal lindsey and c. c. carlson. this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america. a phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry. for many christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. a generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other ""prophecy pundits."" while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book.part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. for lahaye and jerry b. jenkins, it was the pulp novel. back in 1970, lindsay and c. c. carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. like most books of this type (e.g., the bermuda triangle, chariots of the gods?, the philadelphia experiment, the population bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes, i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. after all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a ufo invasion, a famine around the corner, and california falling into the pacific ocean, the authors' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy.however, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. make a bad prediction? no problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book the 1980's: countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief). well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon (another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d.: will mankind survive?). oops, wrong again. first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam (a more recent book is the everlasting hatred: the roots of jihad). when one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies ""right before our eyes"", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels.if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night.however, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. for all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil. for this, its original purpose, the late great planet earth is completely worthless.",0

760,"""dark tort"" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, i found things a bit leaden.  the book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.  i do admit that it also doesn't help that i'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask, ""...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?""  but, that's just me.  oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good, though i doubt i'll get around to making any of them.this is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which i personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one), you'll likely enjoy this installment, too.  the rest of us can just wait for the latest robert b. parker ""spenser"" novel for our light mystery fix.",0
761,"the author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  she goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.the storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  many times, i had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  it is true there were many points in which i wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.i was altogether disappointed in the book.  i thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose",0
762,"apparently the difference between a criminal act (theft) and moral redistribution of income is 1) who you steal from (stealing from the wealthy, of course, is moral -- according to rawls and bolsheviks), and 2) who receives the loot (the non-wealthy makes it moral), and 3) who commits the act (the state/society, of course also makes theft moral; example - taxation), and 4) your intentions (redistribution of income). to look at this another way, if your neighbor breaks into your house and steals your money, that's a crime (unless your neighbor is poor -- which would then be moral and justice, according to rawls' formula). if the community comes into your house and steals from you, it's legal and moral justice, again, according to rawls. because, according to rawls, if, before you were born, you were to vote with everyone on how physical world society should be structured, you'd vote to have the state guarantee that everyone was equal, or they would be compensated somehow for being born (unjustly) less-equal. how? by compensating those with less by stealing from those with more. so those with more would be like oh, say ... a milk-cow who gets milked to serve those with less. so those with more would become a resource, or state-owned slaves to those with less ... because ""society"" (the robin hoods and rawls of the world) deemed this as moral justice. rawls does not take into account those who are willing to take on risk, entrepreneurs, students of life who work to earn an ""a"" vs. students who earn an ""f"". he points out that many people are born into difficult situations through no fault of their own. true. but that does not implicate those within society who are born into better situations as the cause, nor are those who are born into better situations responsible for making up the difference. forcing the ""wealthier"" ones to be accountable for the unfairness within life and pay the bill isn't justice or moral. it would simply be an unjust law. some people see rawls' theory as a blueprint for a future generation utopia (like the bolsheviks envisioned marxism). i see it as an insane blueprint for slavery, and a powerful dis-incentive for earning personal reward and merit. in a sense, this book is an argument against the individual. it sees the world through a blurred lense where the author only recognizes masses of people -- he doesn't recognize any individuals (unless they were born as victims). curious. how do you experience life ... as a group-mind (an oxymoron if there ever was one), a collective? or as a unique, isolated, independent, individual? there should be societal incentives to help each other. okay. but when it is forced (theft of property always implies force), it is no longer an issue of morality or justice -- it's simply a law. without personal choice being involved there is no morality as an issue, by definition. transforming advantaged individuals into mules forced to carry the burdens of the world is a definition of justice for whom?",0

764,"first off i'd like to tell you that this is only the second star wars book i've ever read, 'jedi search' being the first. i actually liked the first book, it drew upon the star wars lore well and was a decent read. however, this book made me groan in so many places that i felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it (be warned, this may contain a few spoilers). thusly:how much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions? it reminds me of a 'little britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the bible out to make up the space! i don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point!for some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to 'ground' the story by constantly relating to the star wars films. for example, when wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there, he says something along the lines of: i was actually in the cantina in mos eisley when luke met han and chewbacca, little did i know the brush i had with history there.... gahhhhhhh!!! why!? how did he know!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk*he does this throughout the two books i've read so far!! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films?then there's admiral daala. made an admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's reviewing recordings of speeches given by tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing! it's only the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer! she should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the rebellion win)he then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea, that of having a jedi academy (the point of the trilogy!). there's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the jedi, but no - he has the jedi go two-by-two into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make this so much better!i was incensed to find that luke was actually made 'boring' in this book. part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how luke had grown. it all started very promisingly in the first book, having learnt that luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever! (cool! i thought). it got to the stage where i'd dread coming back to the jedi parts of the story because he was so dull.the other trainee jedi needed serious character development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene with luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn't good enough.as other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue, somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and luke just meditates about it!? *grr*okay all that being said it was 'okay' and on the strength of the first book i will be reading the next book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to look!).",0
765,"no doubt about it.  this book covers the history of the border patrol.  however, it falls far short of what it ostensibly bills itself and ends up more as a ""fluff piece"" than anything else.as someone who has not only served as a senior border patrol agent (13 years) but also a border patrol union president and outspoken critic of the agency, i have studied this agency inside and out without the affects of tunnel vision that typically accompany the job (many say a necessity).  pacheco, as an active agent (when he wrote the book at least), appears headed in the right direction with the book and then suddenly veers off target.  his somewhat ambiguous message that border security is a difficult task is obviously an attempt to straddle the line (i apologize for the pun) so as not to appear too contentious or controversial.  did he need to seek agency approval for publication since he was actively employed?  if so, then the credibility issue leaps out and the book is worth the historical content alone if nothing else.  if he did not need agency approval and was truly writing without restraint, then he failed to accurately convey the real state of the border patrol and border security.  simply put, the border patrol, as with most of the homeland security subcomponents is disintegrating.  remember the incompetence of fema (a homeland security subcomponent)?  well, multiply that incompetence times ten.  heard about the poor morale of fema employees?  multiply that problem by one-hundred and you have an accurate picture of the border patrol.  a border patrol in which the vast majority of otherwise employable agents spend ninety-percent of their time trying to get out.  those that choose to stay in do so only because of the comparatively worse off agencies in dhs.  the bottom line is that as a former agent, i lose sleep at night knowing what i know.   pacheco did cover the rigorous training regimen accurately even if it bordered on propaganda.  that alone may attract candidates to the difficult and completely unrewarding position of u.s. border patrol agent.  the field stories are completely unappealing to anyone who served more than a week in a law enforcement position unless they are reading about their own exploits.  read the book for enjoyment and homage.  just don't expect critical analysis.  in fact, this book would be an enjoyable read at stewarts bridge (for you ib agents in san diego).",0
766,"when i found out francis collins has written a book about his faith, i ordered it the same day.  after all, we seemed to be following the same path.  i earned a phd in molecular biology in 1981 and had several `firsts' in the area of gene cloning.  then i found christ as a 40-year-old.  my transition was from a semi-serious jew to a materialist to a serious christian.  hearing about dr. collins' spiritual walk had me intrigued.his book should be entitled ""a politician presents evidence for belief"".  it is a completely uncritical view of the last twenty years of biological research.  the human genome project is elevated to status of ""bridge to a momentous new era"".  hogwash.  hype is the term i would use.  the dept. of energy was duped into footing the bill because the national institutes of health saw it as a waste of resources.  the author couldn't make a better case for the payoff than to show humans have more `junk dna' than previously thought.dr. collins then explained darwinian gradualism as if it were dogma.  this oversimplification is typical of those who never studied biology except at a medical school.  this is not entirely his fault, however, since many scientific journals will not publish research where evolution isn't perfectly gradual and perfectly random.  their motivation should be perfectly obvious, but it's not even on dr. collins' radar.  he also uses mendel's peas as a pivotal point in our understanding of genetics, assuming the reader would be ignorant that mendel's data was `dry-labbed'.usually an author who writes on this subject is strong in either biology or theology.  dr. collins relies on two sources for his treatise on theology: st. augustine and  c.s. lewis.  i happen to agree with him that the creation story and the books of job and song of solomon have a ""lyrical and allegorical flavor"".  i would include the book of jonah in that category as well.  however, there is an entire literature on the subject that is completely overlooked.the only time dr. collins makes a strong case for anything, it is to refute edward o wilson, richard dawkins, and their minions.  even then, he uses a quote from the late stephen jay gould for his most scathing criticism.  francis collins is the consummate politician--he takes a stand without offending anyone.  dr. collins knows that jesus was not a politician, and he did not worry about offending the intellectual elites of his time. take this quote from mat 23:14 ""woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.""  dr. collins' book claims to be a middle ground for theists and scientists.  in my opinion it is a  piece of fluff and a narcissistic retelling of the human genome project myth.",0

770,"having been a fan of antonia fraser for many years, i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette, but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual. she depicts marie-antoinette's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married, but arranged marriages were the norm; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary. what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen, of which there is little concrete evidence, but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant. it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more. she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable, unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes. in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france. if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery, it would have been considered treason; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her. with all of her enemies at court, that was not a risk she would have taken, if she had been so inclined. on a smaller scale, fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her, her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it. not that that is a big deal; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser's life ends and where marie-antoinette's life begins. i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy, when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king. especially, since marie-antoinette's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor. sadly, there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language. one can only hope that the works of bertieres, chalon, and delorme will soon be translated and published in english. fraser's book does have some interesting details (aside from those which flow from her imagination) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever's travesty",0
771,"obviously, from all the reviews, this book appeals to many people.  i am not one of them.  perhaps it's because i don't care for science fiction.  i found the writing stilted, the footnotes distracting to the point i stopped bothering with them, the story boring, and the ending (covered in the introduction) to be a twilight zone cliche.  if, like me, you want to read the book because it has some connection to bicycles and cycling you will be disapppointed.",0

774,"oh dear. this is another book like the horrible ""who moved my cheese?"" that attempts to manipulate grown adults by treating them like children.like the aforementioned ""who thinks my cheese stinks?"" (or whatever it is called), i saw some people in the organisation where i work trying to sneakily weave it into the corporate culture and it lasted about five days.it's all about making work ""fun"". yep, work can be ""fun"". tell that to the folks who work in hospital waste disposal. or maybe those who deal with animal cruelty cases.of course, it's just great ""fun"" to deal with children who have just had their parents killed, or folks who just lost their kids.because that's what work is - ""fun"" - or so this book would have you believe you can convince your workers.of course in the examples i have listed above, it doesn't really work too well, because this is really about getting people in perceived lower-end occupations like factories or call-centres to believe their mind-numbing daily tasks can be ""fun"".myself, i do have some ""fun"" at work, but probably like many people with more than one brain cell, it is based on having a laugh with my co-workers about the sheer absurdity of where our work life often takes us.you can call this cynicism, which is probably how it would be viewed by people who buy into this dumb ""fish""-style ""work must be fun"" philosophy. i'd call it black humour, but it keeps people sane and makes difficult work more bearable.as to the title of my review - this method of making the workplace ""fun"" in a forced way is very useful if you have employees that you wish to isolate and marginalise.first immerse people in the cult-like atmosphere and tell them that they are now to regard work as ""fun"".second, let them know that they now ""choose"" their attitude - if they are unhappy in any way (regardless of them doing their work well or not), they are ""letting the team down"" and not complying with the obligation to ""make work fun"".third, while the majority of victims or workers, however you choose to view your prey, swallow the ""work is fun"" message and display the behaviour of sea lions clapping to get a mouthful of fish, you can point to those who have shown a small streak of individual identity and are not having fun at work and use the enron-style message that they ""just don't get it"".in this way, the resistant individual can be said to be ""incompatible with our mission and values"", ""bad for morale"" or just ""out of step"".in this way, the ""fun-loving"" workers, who have now taken on the costume of ""forced false fun"" can be set against them.of course this will compound their unhappiness and isolate them further until they are totally marginalised and can be tossed on the scrapheap or forced to resign.this book is useful then, if you wish to convince idiots that their ""work is fun"".just don't try it on a group of people with a brain between them who might take their work seriously.they might tell you to stick your ""fish"" where the sun doesn't shine",0
775,"this is a tough review to write because i felt the authors made a good effort in the writing of the book and explanations of the spring framework. writing a book is no small feat, and technical books are a special beast.with that last statement in mind, this is were the book sadly falls short. for one, the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books' code. the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print. while improvement is always good, this presents two problems. 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material. not a good thing for those trying to learn, as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book. also, and this is not to disparage the authors skill, but i buy books because i am expecting experienced, if not expert advice. if a small, sample application needs rewriting, perhaps they should write about something else?further down this road, the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling. i suspect that the final build file was not tested, or it was a case of ""well, it compiles on my machine"". there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled. thankfully, i use eclipse and imported the project. eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies, which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive. examples are:jakarta-commons/collections, and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access.for an experienced developer, familiar with ant and a good ide, it was not a lot of trouble to get it running, it just did not give me a good impression.bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql: first, no matter what db you swap in, you'll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file. i made property variables which i placed in build.properties. then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it. ). another great reason to use eclipse. why you must change it, is user is a reserved keyword in postgresql and you will get databases errors because you can't name a table user",0
776,"this series may be good for a laugh. some of the writing is engaging. but the premise is absurd. why, in this day and age, should anyone accept the world-view of the bible? a book that tells us to buy and sell slaves, stone our wives to death if they accept some other tribe's beliefs, and subordinate our minds to an absolute despot up in the clouds of mt. sinai? in a sense, bible believers have been ""left behind"" since the 1700s enlightenment. tom paine's ""the age of reason"" showed the god of the bible to be a cruel, vindictive monster. and what did thomas jefferson call the book of revelations? ""the ravings of a madman."" read this series, if you like. enjoy parts of it. but make no mistake: to take any of this seriously, you have to regress to a prehistoric world-view, before men learned to think, to ask questions; before logic or science -- a time when dazed, superstitious primitives believed stars could fall to the earth, if they didn't grovel humbly enough to their supposed god. do the absurdities and contradictions bother no one? when the ""sheep"" are raptured up to heaven, their clothes are left behind. so heaven is a nudist colony? the basic contradiction, of course, lies in using worldly action (some of it exciting) to proselytize for the unworldly, the supernatural. but why should we care whether any of the ""good"" guys gets killed? and why should they mind -- won't they go straight up to heaven? that's what they want, isn't it? why even lift a finger against the ""bad"" guys -- didn't christ say, ""resist not evil""? worried about who will win? ""god"" is infinitely powerful. so jesus (who is 1/3 of god -- or something like that) is sure to win when armageddon rolls around, in book 12 of the series. and the ""sheep"" -- the believers -- will happily worship him, looking just like the pictures of dim-witted, bovine people you see in the tracts jehovah's witnesses leave at your door. the going price for a used copy of ""tribulation force"" is one cent. does that tell you something? actually, the story-telling is worth more. the basic premise is worth less. perhaps it averages out",0

778,"eugene o'neill's play ""long day's journey into night"" is a pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. i must admit that though eugene o'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater, i did not enjoy reading this play. the tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o'neill offered no conclusion. the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. no happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. ""long day's journey into night"" is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without. however, after learning more about eugene o'neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, i began to have a greater appreciation for this play. o'neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. while o'neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as eugene's own family never got a happy ending. i did like the clever way o'neill showed the tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. the audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. although i still believe ""long day's journey into night"" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o'neill's exceptional writing.",0
779,"despite the fact that hanegraaff's name is the bigger of the two on the front cover, only the first 40 pages of this very small book are worth reading, and they are the writing of paul maier.  his research is helpful, but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn't given a week-end to write it and come up with as much as he could.  every topic needs futher information.  a lot more could be said, and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more.hanegraaff contributes 29 pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface-level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere.that said, i would give this book to someone who isn't much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions.  it isn't much more than a collection of scattered soundbites, but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction",0
780,"this book reads like a horror novel.by allowing her dogs (as well as another one in her care) to roam freely throughout an urban area crisscrossed by busy roads, the author demonstrates her utter disregard for the animals' welfare.  not to mention the antisocial attitude she displays with her total inconsideration for her neighbors, and for the countless strangers kind enough to phone when her lost dogs seek refuge on their doorsteps.oh, and let's not forget the dozens of shelter dogs killed because their potential adoptive homes were filled by the plethora of puppies spawned by the author's choice not to spay and neuter her animals.this book moves at a peppy pace, and might have been interesting (albeit morally reprehensible) if the author's ""observations"" actually provided any insight.  but those eighteen-wheelers on the alewife parkway veered closer to poor misha than the author's whimsical interpretations stray within range of scientific evidence.  case in point:  she is so clueless about the reality of canine behavior that she inadvertently allows one of her dogs to kill another one's litter of puppies.  oops!any genuine dog lover (or any human with an ounce of compassion and common sense) will despise this book.  a previous reviewer hit the nail on the head: if ""feelings"" are your road map to life, you might enjoy this book.  if you regularly take your brain out for walk, forget it.  calling this a meaningful book about dogs is like calling ""jonathan livingston seagull"" the definitive text on marine fowl",0

789,"``people  say again and again that philosophy  doesn't really progress, that we  are still occupied  with the same philosophical problems as were  the greeks.  but  the people who say this don't understand why is has to be  so. it is because our language has remained the same and  keeps seducing us  into asking the same questions.  as long as there continues to be a verb  'to be' that  looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to eat' and  'to  drink', as long as we still have the adjectives  'identical', 'true',  'false', 'possible', as  long as we continue to talk of a river of time, of  an expanse of  space, etc., etc., people will keep stumbling over the  same puzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring at something which  no explanation seems capable of clearing up. and what's more, this  satisfies  a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar  as people think they can  see `the limits of human  understanding', they believe of course that they  can see  beyond these.`` ''philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language````ambition is the death of  thought''' these three quotes are from ludwig wittgenstein who redefined philosophy some 70 years ago (but most people have yet to find this out). dennett, though he has  been a philosopher for some 40 years, is one them. it is also curious that both he and his prime antagonist, john searle, studied under famous wittgensteinians (searle with john austin, dennett with gilbert ryle) but searle got the point and dennett did not. dennett is a hard determinist(though he trys to sneak  reality in the back door), and perhaps this is due to ryle, whose famous book 'the concept of mind'(1949) continues to be reprinted.  that book did a great job of exorcising the ghost but it left the machine.  dennett enjoys  making  the mistakes wittgenstein, ryle(and many others since) have exposed in detail. by accident,just before this book, i had  read ''the minds i'', which dennett coauthored with douglas hofstadter in 1981. they made some bad  mistakes(see my review), and saddest of all, they reprinted  two famous articles that pointed the way out of the mess---nagel's `what is  like to be a bat?` and an early version of john  searle's chinese room argument explaining why computers  don't think.   nagel pointed out that we do not even know how to recognize what a concept of a bat's mind would be  like.  searle similarly explained how we lack a way to conceptualize  thinking  and how it  differs from what a computer does(eg, it can translate chinese  without understanding it). likewise, we lack a clear test for recognizing  what counts as good  vs bad--or just intelligible-- for many philosophical and scientific concepts. our  use of the words consciousness, choice, freedom, intention,  particle, thinking, determines, wave, cause, happened,  event(and so on endlessly) are  rarely a source of confusion  but as soon as we leave normal life and enter philosophy(and any discussion detached from the environment  in  which language evolved) chaos reigns. wittgenstein  was the first to understand why and to point out how to avoid  this. unfortunately, he died in his prime, his works are composed almost entirely of a series of examples of  how the mind(language)  works and he never wrote any popular books,  so  understanding of his work is restricted to a very few. searle  is one of the world's leading philosophers and has written  many extremely clear  and highly regarded articles and books,some of which have pointed out the  glaring defects in dennett's work. his review ``consciousness explained  away'' of dennetts 1991 book `'consciousness explained'' and his book ''the mystery of consciousness'' are very well  known,and show, in a way that is amazingly clear for philosophical writing,why neither dennett(nor any of the  hundreds of philosophers and scientists who have written on this topic)have come close to explaining the hard problem--ie, how do you conceptualize consciousness. many suspect we will never be able to conceptualize any of the really important things, but it is clear that we are  nowhere near it now. dennett has mostly  ignored his critics but has favored  searle with vituperative personal attacks. searle has been accused by dennett and others of  being out to destroy cognitive psychology which is quite funny as modern philosophy is(mostly) a branch of cognitive psychology and searle has made it very clear for 30 years that we are a good example of a biological machine that is conscious, thinks, etc,.  he just points out that we don't have any idea how this happens.   searle characterizes as ''intellectual pathology'', the views of dennett and all those who deny the existence of the very phenomena they set out to explain. dennett repeats his  mistakes here and leaves his reply to his critics to the penultimate page of  the book, where we are told that they are all mistaken and it is a waste of space to show how! unsurprisingly, there is not one reference to wittgenstein or searle in the entire book. there are however, many references to other old school philosophers who are as confused as he is. like most people, it does not cross his mind that the very inference engines he thinks with are forcing him to come to  certain conclusions and that these will often be quite  unconnected with or wrong about the way things are in the  world. they are a jumble of evolutionary curiosities which do various tasks in organizing behavior that were useful for survival hundreds of thousands of years ago. wittgenstein was a pioneer in doing thought experiments in cognitive psychology and began to elucidate the nature of these engines and the subtleties of language in the 30's, and thus he made the sorts of comments that this review begins with. dennett says(p98)that  his view is compatibilism, ie, that  free will(which i hope we can equate with choice) is compatible with  determinism(ie, that ''there is at any instant exactly one physically  possible  future''--p25). he wants to show that determinism is not the same as inevitablity. however, the whole book is smoke  and mirrors by means of  which choice, in the sense we normally  understand it, disappears and we are  left with ``choice``,  which is something we cannot choose. naturally, this  echoes  the fate of consiousness in his earlier book ``consciousness  explained``. it is remarkable that, at a time when we are  just beginning to  reach the point where we might be able to understand the basics of how a  single neuron works(or how an  atom works for that matter), that anyone should  think they can  make the leap to understanding the whole brain and to explain  its most complex phenomena. please recall the last sentence of wittgenstein  from the opening quote: '' and what's more, this satisfies a longing for the transcendent, because, insofar as  people think they can see `the limits of  human understanding',  they believe of course that they can see beyond  these.`` the  relation between language, thought and reality is  extraordinarily complex and everyone gets lost. if one is very, very  careful, some understanding is possible, but dennett throws caution to  the  winds and we are dragged into the quicksand. there are  at least 3 different  topics here(evolution of our brain, choice  and morality) and dennett tries  vainly to weld them together into  a coherent account of how freedom evolves  from the deterministic  crashing of atoms. there is, however, no compelling  reason to  accept that bouncing atoms (or his favorite example, the game  of  life running on a computer) are isomorphic with reality.  he knows that  quantum indeterminacy(or the uncertainty principle)  is a major obstacle to  determinism however defined(and has  been taken by many as an escape to  freedom) but dismisses  it due to the fact that such events are too rare to  bother  with. by extension, its unlikely that any such  event will happen now or even in our  whole lifetime in our  brain, so we appear to be stuck with a determined  brain(whatever  that may be). however, the universe is a big place and its been  around a long time(perhaps forever) and if even one such quantum  effect occurs  it would seem to throw the whole universe into  an indeterminate state. the  notion ''there is at any  instant exactly one physically possible future''  cannot be true  if at any instant a quantum indeterminacy can occur--in this  case  there would seem to be infinitely many possible futures. this  recalls  one of the escapes from the contradictions of physics--each  instant our  universe is branching into infinitely many universes. he correctly rejects the idea that quantum indeterminacy gives us the answer to how we can have choice.  this obvious idea has been suggested by many but the problem is that nobody has any idea how to specify an exact sequence of steps which starts with the equations of physics and ends up with the phenomena of consciousness(or any other emergent phenomenon).  if so, they will definitely win at least one nobel prize, for not only will they have explained consciousness, they will have explained the universal phenomenon of emergence(how higher order properties emerge from lower ones). so, they would have to solve the 'easy' problem(to determine the exact state of the brain corresponding to some mental state and preferably specify the exact position of all the atoms in the brain over time-ignoring uncertainty) and the 'hard' one(what exactly correlates with or produces consciousness or choice etc?). and while they are at it how about also doing the  impossible--an exact and full solution to the quantum field equations for a brain.  it is very well known that these equations are uncomputable, even for one atom or a vacuum, as it would require an infinite amount of computer time.  but infinite will do for one atom so maybe a brain will take no longer. he starts off on the  first page appealing to the laws of  physics for protection against fantastic  notions such as immaterial souls, but physics is made of notions just as  fantastic(uncertainty,  entanglement, wave/particle duality, schrodinger's  dead/alive cat etc) and as feynmann said many times ``nobody understands physics!'' many think nobody ever will. on pg  2 he says  our values have little to do with the goals of our cells and  on pg 2  to3 that our personality differences are due to how  our ''robotic teams are  put togther, over a lifetime of  growth and experience.`` this is a bald  dismissal of human  nature, of the abundant evidence that our differences are  to  a large extent programmed into our genes and fixed in early  childhood, and  is typical of his constant confused wandering  back and forth between  determinism and environmentalism.on page  9 he notes that free will is a problem and our  attitudes to  it make a difference, but for whom? nobody but philosophers. we make choices. what's the problem?  one has to step  outside life to experience a problem and then  everything becomes a problem.  what are consciousness, pain,  yellow, intention, matter, quarks, gravity  etc.? i doubt that  anyone has ever experienced a fundamental change in their  interactions  with people or their decision making processes due to their  thinking about choice. this shows that there is something  strange about such questions. wittgenstein would probably say that the language games are  different. there are games  for language connected with the cognitive  templates for decisions  or seeing colors etc, and thinking philosophically is operating them in decoupled mode. decoupled modes permit  thinking about the past, planning for the future, guessing  the mental states  of others, etc, but if one takes the results  in the wrong way and starts to  think `'john will try to steal  my wallet'', rather than just imagining that  john might  do it, confusion enters and those who cannot turn off the decoupled  mode or distinguish it from coupled mode,  enter the realm of pathology. some aspects of schizophrenia and other mental illness might be  seen this way--they lose control of which mode they are in, eg, not being able to see the  difference between the motives people  have and the motives they might have.  one can then see  much of the philosophizing people do as operating in  these  decoupled modes but failing to be able to keep in front of them  the  differences from the normal mode. normal mode--eg, what  is that lion doing--  was undoubtedly the first one evolved  and decoupled modes--what did that lion  do last time or what  does he intend to do next--evolved later. this was  probably  never a problem for animals--any animal that spent too much  time  worrying about what might happen would not be very successful  contributing to  the gene pool. it is interesting to speculate that only when humans developed  culture and began degenerating genetically, could large numbers of people  survive with genes that  led them to spend alot of time in decoupled modes.  hence, we  have philosophy and this book, which is mostly about running the  decision templates in decoupled mode where there are no real  consequences except earning royalties for putting the results  in a book for other people to  use to run their engines in decoupled mode.' let us alter wittgenstein's quote to read:  ''as long as there continues to be a verb 'to decide'  that looks as if it functions in the same way as 'to  eat' and 'to  drink', as long as we continue to talk of  freedom of action, of saying i  wish i had done otherwise,  etc., etc., people will keep stumbling over the  same puzzling  difficulties and find themselves staring at something which  no  explanation seems capable of clearing up. ''as with most philosophy books, nearly every page, often every paragraph,  changes from one type of language  game to another without  noticing that now one would have to be joking or  dreaming  or acting in a play or reciting a story , etc, and not actually  intending anything nor describing an actual situation in the  world. on page  10 he says we count on free will for the  whole way of thinking about our lives,  like we count on food  and water, but who ever, outside philosophy, standing in  front  of lunch counter full of food, ever thinks how fine it is that  they  have free will so they can pick coke instead of mineral  water? even if i  want to be a serious compatibilist and  try thinking this in decoupled mode, i  have to exit and  enter nondecoupled mode to make the actual choice. only then  can i go back to decoupled mode to wonder what might have  happened if i had  not had the ability to make a real choice.  wittgenstein noted how pretend  games are parasitic on real ones(this is not a trivial observation!).  the ability to engage in very complex  decoupled scenarios  is already evident in 4 year old children. so i would say  that normally, nobody counts on having choice, but rather we just choose. on the same page he shows again that he does not grasp cognitive  basics.  he says we learn to conduct our lives in the conceptual  atmosphere of choice,  and that `'it appears to be a stable  and ahistorical construct, as eternal  and unchanging as arithmetic,  but it is not.'' and on page 13--''it is an  evolved creation  of human activity and beliefs''. the whole thrust of  cognitive  psychology is that we do not learn the basics of planning, deciding,  promising, resenting, etc, but that these are built-in functions  of the  inference engines that work automatically and unconsciously  and start running  in very early childhood. there is no evidence  that they change as we grow,  or are in any way subject to  our beliefs,only  that they mature just as our body does. on pg 14 he suggests  its probable that our having free will depends on our believing  we have  it!  do we believe we see an apple, feel a pain, are  happy? the language  game of belief is very different from  that of knowing. we can believe we have  a dollar in our  pocket but if we take it out and look at it we can't  meaningfully  then say that we still believe it(except as a joke etc.). the  inference engine can run in decoupled(belief) mode so we can  imagine having choices or making them, but in life we just make them and it is only in very  odd situations we can say  that we believe we made a choice. but dennett is  saying this is the universal case. if making a choice had any dependence on belief than so would everything everything else--consciousness,  seeing,  thinking,etc. if we take this seriously(and he says 'the serious problems of  free will' ) then we are getting  into trouble and if we actually try to apply  it to life, then madness is minutes away. . on page 65 et seq., he  discusses causation, intention and the `informal predicates'  that we use to  describe atoms etc, but cognitive resarch has  shown that we describe all  objects with a limited number of  ontological categories which we analyse with  our intuitive physics  modules and that when agents (ie animals or people or  things  like them--ie, ghosts or gods) are involved we use our  concepts (engines)  for agency, intuitive psychology, social minds, etc to  decide  how to behave. there is almost certainly no causation module  but  rather it will involve all of these and other inference  engines, depending on  the precise situation. discussing  possibility and necessity is much  easier if  one talks in terms of the output of our modules for intuitive  physics,  agency, ontological categories etc. of course there is no mention  here of wittgenstein's many incisive comments on causation,  intention,  deciding, nor of searle's now classic works  on intention and social reality. he spends much time on  ainslie's book 'breakdown of will', in which is  discussed  the hyperbolic discounting faculties (ie, inference engines) by which  we evaluate probable outcomes.he makes much of the excellent work of robert frank on altruism, emotion and economics, but the book he cites was 15 years old when this book was published. it was bingham's idea, amplified by frank and by boyd and richardson (1992) that  cooperation  was greatly stimulated by the evolution of means for punishing cheaters. he suggests these as examples of darwinian approaches  that are obligatory and promising. indeed they are, and  in fact they are standard  parts of economic, evolutionary  and cognitive theory, but unfortunately, he  makes little reference  to the other work in these fields. all that work tends to show that people do not choose but their brains choose for them. he does not establish any convincing connection between this work and the general problem of choice. on pg 216 he says that making oneself so  that one could not have  done otherwise is a key innovation in  the evolutionary ascent to free will,  and that we can only  be free if we learn how to render ourselves insensitive  to  opportunities. but where this ability resides is not revealed  for  several chapters! dennett has a penchant for hiding  his ideas in a massive  amount of rather irrelevant text.  again, he gets things backwards, as there is  a vast body of  very good evidence from biology and psychology that we are get  the feelings that we should behave in some way from our inference engines and  these are not provided by some part of our conscious  self, but by the automatic and unconscious operation of the  engines. as he notes, hundreds of experiments  with the prisoner's dilemma  and related protocols have shown how easy it is to  manipulate  people's choices and that their calculations are not conscious  and  deliberate at all. when the situation is manipulated to  make them conscious, they are much slower and  less reliable. so, there has been  constant pressure of natural  selection to make the engines fast and automatic  and inacessible  to deliberate thought.dennett says `we make ourselves'  so  that we could not do otherwise and that this is the basis  of morality and  choice. the evidence would seem to be exactly  the opposite. our inference engines give  us basic moral intuitions and  we generally act in accord with the results.  if we or others  do not we feel guilt, outrage, resentment etc, then cheater genes will invade the population and this is one of the main theories as to how a good part of morality evolved. our genes make us so we can't(mostly) do otherwise, not our will or whatever dennett thinks can do it.   we can often choose to do otherwise but our own  intuitions and the knowledge of social disapproval  usually serve to limit our choices. these intuitions evolved  in small groups between 50,000 and some  millions of years ago. in the modern world the intuitions are often not to  our  advantage and the social controls weak. this is a prime reason for the chaos in the world.on pg  225 he finally sneaks in a definition of free will  as ''a complicated snarl of mechanistic causes that look like decision making(from certain angles)''. he claims that this plays all the valuable  roles of free will but lacks some  (unspecified) properties possessed by  traditional free will.  the smoke is thick but i  am pretty  sure one of those unspecified properties is what we understand as choice. he insists(top pg 226) that his naturalistic  account of decision  making leaves plenty of room for moral  responsibility, but making ourselves so  we couldn't do otherwise  does not seem to describe the way we actually  function, nor  does it seem to leave any room for morality, as that would seem  to consist precisely in being able to do otherwise. he  does not propose  any test for deciding if a choice is voluntary  or forced and i doubt he could  do so. normally if someone  asks us to move our hand, we know what counts as  having a  choice, but, typical of philosophers, i expect that regardless  of  whether it moves or not he will count both as evidence for his position. at this point he also starts his discussion of libet's well known work on conscious attention which is the only part of the book that i felt was worth my time. on page 253 et seq., he sneaks in his definition of conscious will--the  ''brains user illusion  of itself''' which has as one of its main roles  providing  ''me with the means of interfacing with myself at other times``.  and ``illusory or not, conscious will is the persons guide  to his or her own  moral responsibility for action.`` he says  the trick we need is to see that  ``i`' control what is happening  inside the ''simplification barrier''...  ''where decision  making happens''. ``mental events'' become conscious by  ''entering  into memory''. ''the process of self description... is  what we  are''. the crucial thing is that choice is possible  because the self is  distributed over space(the brain) and time(memories).  he realizes this is  going to leave many incredulous(everyone who can follow this and really understands!). ''i know that many  people find it hard to grasp this idea or take it seriously. it seems to them  to be a trick with mirrors, some kind of verbal slight of hand that whisks consciousness, and the real self , out of the picture just when it was about to  be introduced.'' many will say he took the words out of their mouth, but i would  say it's incoherent and  that everything we know about consciousness and the whole  universe(making the obvious extensions of such claims)  was gone long before we got this far. on pg 259 he says that culture has made us rational animals!  this is a stunning denial of human nature(ie, genetics and evolution) coming from the person who wrote 'darwin's dangerous idea''!  presumably he is talking about his idea that it is memories spread over space(the brain and other people) and time that give us choices and morals and consciousness(line 6 from bottom).  he says consciousness is a user-interface but it is never made clear who or where the user is and how it interfaces with the brain(you will have to suffer through 'consciousness explained to find that there is no answer there either).  though he makes many references to evolutionary and cognitive psychology, he seldom uses any of the terminology that has been current for decades(social mind, intuitive psychology, coalitional intuitions etc) and clearly is not familiar with most of the concepts. if he means that we got the fine details of morality from culture, thats ok, but this is the icing on the cake and the cake was baked by the genes.  we are also told here that r&d(by which he means evolution here, but other things elsewhere) has given us the self  and that language creates new kind of consciousness and morality.  i am sure that he will get little agreement on this.  it seems quite clear that consciousness and the basics of morality evolved in primates(and earlier) long before spoken language(though it is a very deep topic as to how language evolved from extant capacities in the brain).  he continues ``morality memes arose by accident some tens of thousands of years ago`` which would be ok if he meant the icing on the cake but he clearly means the cake!  and then he says the point of morality is not the survival of our genes, which is an amazing (and totally incorrect)thing to say, even if he was only referring to memes.  on pg 260 he claims  that  because we do not comprehend our ''bland dispositions  to cooperate'', they  mean nothing to us, but it is the operation  of our templates that is  everything to us. there is ample  evidence that if one of them is damaged a  person cannot function  properly as a social being(eg, autism).  i would say it is the operation of the templates for intuitive psychology etc which lead dennett to the counterintuitive views that we do not have consciousness and choice in the way we think.  he also says here that it was one of the major  evolutionary transitions when we were able to change our views and reflect on reasons for them. this again reflects his lack of understanding of evolutionary psychology.  i know of no evidence that the basic moral intuitions, like all the templates, are accessible to consciousness.  we may decide our cheating was justifiable, or forgive someone else's cheating, but we still know it was cheating(ie, we cannot change the engine). i suspect my ancestors a million years ago had the same feelings in the same situation but what has happened is that there are lots of other things that may be taken as relevant and that sometimes these will lead me to act contrary to my feelings.  another issue is that as culture developed, one had to make many important or 'moral type` decisions for which the engines were not evolved to give a clear answer.  on pg 267 he says that we now replace our `free floating rationales'(probably corresponding to what cognitive psychologists call our templates or inference engines) with reflection and mutual persuasion. and on pg 286 he says that it is a child's upbringing --demanding and giving reasons-- that affects moral reasoning. again, he just has no grasp of what has happened in the last 30 years of research--the templates do not change with reflection or upbringing. we are then told again that consciousness makes moral issues available over time to the self, which takes responsibility.  it is not any more coherent or credible with repetition.  on pg 289 he has a chapter summary which repeats the mistaken notions that it is culture that makes it possible to reflect and that choice depends on education(memory) and sharing.  it's clear that it is not culture but the inherited cognitive structures that make it possible to reflect and to choose and that culture determines the acceptable actions and their rewards or punishments. on pg 303 he discusses the classic philosophical barrier between 'ought'and 'is' , unaware that our templates solved that problem long ago--ie, they tell us how to feel about situations regarding other people.  he also seems to be unaware that there are hundreds of cultural universals implanted in our genes(eg see 'the blank slate'). he often starts into what looks like its going to be a good discussion of some issue in evolutionary psychology, but invariably wanders off into philosophical arcana and winds up with more confusion.  this happens on pg 261 where he states that concepts like 'praiseworthy' were shaped over millennia by culture, while most would say the basis for such concepts is in the genes and each culture only detetermines the details of acceptable reactions to the intuitions its members get from their innate mechanisms.   on pg 262 he tries to explain how an ess(evolutionarily stable strategy) can produce morality. his idea here is that genetic `r&d` produces dim understandings of morals and then culture(memetics) produces variations and clarifications.  i would say that we all know, and much research has made clear, that we commonly get very clear results from our inference engines and only dimly understand in special cases.  culture merely decides what we can do about our feelings.  the last part of the book is mostly  concerned  with moral culpability. he refers to the legal classic by hart  and  honore, which i started reading 30 years ago since it's  authors were deeply influenced by wittgenstein.  dennett tells us that we have  control over our own morality and  that thinking about morality will improve us.  but, there seems  no justification whatever for this view in this book. there is nothing at  all  here to help anyone escape from the dictates of the monkey mind. it is a defensible point of view that those who manage this do so by traveling a spiritual path that  has no connection with philosophy- and there is not a hint of  spirituality in this entire book--another telling point considering that many mystics have fascinating things to say about the functioning of the mind. i find  more wisdom about how  to be free and moral in any of osho's 200 books than anywhere in philosophy. one rarely finds spiritually and morally  advanced people teaching at universities. there is no sign here, nor in  anything he has done, that dennett is morally superior. after 40 years of thinking about morality he launches personal attacks on his critics or arrogantly dismisses them.  it seems clear that, like all of us, he is trapped in the limits of his inference engines. so, how much opportunity is there to  improve our morality? it seems  clear(eg, see pinker's `the blank slate`) that  most of our behaviour  is genetic and the rest due to unknown factors in our  environment, in spite of the vigorous efforts of parents and religions and political parties. on  average, maybe 5% of the variation in moral behavior(variations are the only thing we can  study) is due to our own efforts. the moral choices that matter  most today are  those affecting the fate of the world. but our moral templates were not evolved to deal with overpopulation and the greenhouse effect. how remarkable it would be if just one of the hundreds of millions of educated people in the world managed to figure out what consiousness or choice or any mental phenomenon really is.  and if one did, we would expect them to be a scientist at the cutting edge of research using some exotic fmri  equipment and the latest parallel processing neural networked fuzzy logic computer etc.  but a philosopher or physicist just sitting there thinking, coming up with the solution to the greatest puzzle there is!  and then writing a whole book about it without checking with the sceptics first.  to return to the quote at the beginning--'ambition is the death of thought'.  indeed--though clearly wittgenstein was thinking of interesting thoughts",0

794,"this book really wasn't at all what i was expecting, or what the title would lead one to believe. the subtitle, ""in search of grace o'malley and other legendary women of the sea,"" makes it sound as if this will be a biographical account of the life of grace o'malley, with supplemental information on other historical female seafarers. not so. the first two chapters are devoted to the famous pirate queen herself, and sjoholm only provides the skimpiest bits of information. i knew almost nothing about grace o'malley going into the book, and i know little more than that now. the other women included are discussed in even sparer detail, and most of them aren't even real historical figures, but legendary story characters and mythological creatures like mermaids. she even talks about pippi longstocking! not what i was expecting at all...""the pirate queen"" is actually devoted far more to sjoholm's travels in search of information on female women of the sea than it is to the information itself. i learned more about sjoholm and her own life than about the women she supposedly set out to study. she describes the inns she stayed at, the weather, the tourists she met, her own childhood, the abundance of ""personal bath mats"" in northern european hotels... almost everything but grace o'malley and her cohorts. in fact, the primary underlying theme in the book seems to be how the author came to the decision to change her last name from wilson to sjoholm; a story which, to be quite honest, i really couldn't care less about. i bought the book hoping to learn about interesting historical figures. it turned out to be a travel memoir, and a comparatively uninteresting one at that.this is a shame, really. sjoholm includes just enough information on the various historical women she mentions - grace o'malley herself, bessie millie, janet forsyth, christian robertson, eliza fraser, isobel gunn, betty mouat, freydis eiriksdottir, skipper thuridur, trouser-beret, alfhild, the ""herring lassies,"" and numerous mythological characters - to whet my appetite, but then fails to deliver a full, satisfying portrait of any of them. she raises more questions than she answers, and i'd need to buy numerous additional books to find all the missing information. you may also notice, given the names, that nearly all the women mentioned are northern european in origin. sjoholm entirely omits women seafarers active in other parts of the world, such as the famous pirates anne bonney and mary read who, though from europe, sailed the caribbean.as for sjoholm's writing style, the book is an easy read, but not a very enjoyable one. sjoholm's writing is given to an abundance of nearly nauseating metaphors. for example: ""the lava fields looked like vanilla cake batter poured over thick jumbles of dates, walnuts, and chocolate chips. in the sun the moss could also look like lemon yogurt spooned generously over granola"" (pg. 222). flowery, gratuitous, and often ridiculous images like this are to be found in almost every paragraph... peppered throughout the book like poppyseeds in a muffin, you might say... it's not the worst book i've ever read, but i do wish i'd spent my money on something else. it doesn't deliver what it promises, and there are plenty of more interesting and informative books out there to pick up instead",0

798,"i had heard of the importance, and significance of ""the education of henry adams"" for a long time. i finally determined i needed to read it.i acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first. i am sorry  i missed the greatness of this book. i am sure there was something wrong with me, but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive. perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man. he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house, and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there. granted, he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the white house. but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like adams depresses me. why did anyone bother? he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. the world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day. he was a very good historian in his time. but who reads his books now? not very many. in short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams.""the education of henry adams"" does not have much real information. he got education in one place, none in others. surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book. when eric sevareid wrote ""not so wild a dream,"" it was compared to ""the education of henry adams."" that was meant as a compliment. oddly, i think sevareid's book is much, much better. sevareid wrote of america, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. adams needed to get out more. he did not see america--not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid. i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams. again, a lot of this might be me. perhaps i read the book at a bad time. maybe i needed to read it a third time. i do not know. i do know i do not think this is a great american classic. forgive, please, my ignorance.",0

803,"david fromkin's ""peace to end all peace"" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.fromkin attempts to examine how the modern middle east (extending as far as afghanistan and some sections of central asia) was created during and after the first world war. obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the ottoman empire in that war must be considered.this is where fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. focusing on the european political machinations to resolve the ""eastern question"" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of churchill and te lawrence than of the arabs and turks who were also involved in the process. admittedly, it was the europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the cup triumvirate in the dying ottoman empire (and kemal ataturk in turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. a complex web of national and personal political interests in both europe and the middle east combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. the problem that fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all.the story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.additionally, fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. indeed, one map (showing enver pasha's advance on baku and his campaigns in central asia) is laughable in the extreme. the legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.where fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely european sources. it is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern middle east, but i have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the middle eastern aspects of the events in question. in terms of europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.ultimately, ""a peace to end all peace"" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. a diplomatic history of europe during the great war can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the middle east following that conflict already has been (the chapters in margaret attwood's ""the peacemakers"" or william cleveland's ""modern middle east"" both easily outshine this)",0

808,"after reading the delightful charlie and the chocolate factory, this sequel was an absolute let-down. the novel begins with the great glass elevator breaking through the ceiling of charlie's (formerly wonka's) chocolate factory and rocketing into orbit around the earth. while beyond the reaches of earth's atmosphere, our heroes---charlie, grandpa joe, and mr. wonka---must deal with the malleable and voracious vermicious knids (pronounced ""k'nids""), aliens which resemble unfrighteningly hostile figs or turds with eyes. far worse than these beasties, though, are the insufferable old folks whose twenty-year stint in their shared bed has made them less than useless. charlie, joe, and wonka, with no help from charlie's folks or other grandparents, save themselves and a us spacecraft from the clutches of the knids and return to the chocolate factory, where the old timers stupidly overdose on youth pills, returning them to infancy or beyond. charlie and wonka race around trying to help these ancient parasites, who respond to this assistance with the thanklessness the reader comes to expect from these oldsters. at the end of the novel, the geriatric brigade finally leaves the bed when they have a chance to meet the president.in short, these three are the most tedious, spiteful, unredeemable characters i've come across in children's literature and i hoped that they would be eaten by the knids or the gnoolies or even the oompa-loompas as i read this book. as it is, they (unlike the awful kids in the chocolate factory) learn no lessons and persist in their curmudgeonly parasitism from the first page to the last. their presence throughout the novel rendered it a chore, rather than a joy, to read.",0

""you drive too fast!""  ""are you my mother?""  over and over and over.  the idea was good.  a modern-day frankenstein . . . or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, i know, frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  but you get what i'm saying.).  but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  this book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly",0
832,"there are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.in this review we will concentrate on rima's(r)handling of the work of j m keynes.on p.84,r's claim that the physiocratic concept of hoarding is &quot;surprisingly suggestive&quot; of j m keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.on p.133,r claims that malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la keynes.what malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.nowhere does malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to ricardo.what malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with ricardo.in chapter 20 of r's book, she attempts to deal with keynes's theory of effective demand and keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled &quot;the employment function&quot;.r should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with keynes's chapter 20.r's figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts keynes's analysis",0
833,"to cover all the problems with continuity, logic, theology, geography and plain common sense in _left behind_ would take a whole book.  one hardly knows where to start.perhaps it is too early to assess the damage that will be done to christian religion by this trashy novel.  as such, it isn't even a decent trashy novel; instead of steamy sex scenes, we get sanctimonious sermonizing.  worse than that, what the authors have done is to turn the powerful imagery of the bible into a cheap comic book, ignoring its spiritual messages in favor of promoting a self-centered preoccupation with getting a ticket to heaven before it's too late.the comic book aspect can not be overemphasized.  even if you suspend disbelief enough to accept the rapture scenario (an idea with virtually no scriptural support), little in the characters' actions, thought processes or dialog rings true.  one gets the impression that the book was hastily thrown together by a junior high school student.  god ends up looking like the ultimate villain, demanding that you hurry up and get yourself and your friends on his side or else.whatever happened to the inspiring christian writers of yesteryear?  who is the present-day equivalent of c. s. lewis, or catherine marshall, and why aren't they getting more attention?  these were writers who actually made you think.  lahaye and jenkins seem to believe that thinking is the last thing god wants us to be doing; they hardly miss a chance to put down anyone with any hint of intelligence or independent thought.  they show no interest in answering the sort of hard questions that surviving non-believers in such a world might ask.  one wonders if they have ever met a non-believer at all, or witnessed the aftermath of a disaster for that matter.these days, it seems as if all the media attention is on the likes of ann coulter or pat robertson, whose mission seems to be to turn christianity into a twisted, bigoted caricature of what it once was.  perhaps all the great religious thinkers really have been raptured.  if _left behind_ is an example of the sort of writing that we can expect from christian writers, then it is the church itself that is in danger of being left behind",0

835,"i read this book with an open mind.  i am familiar with the tremendous criticism that has arisen from claims that survivors of child abuse may use their backgrounds to claim some sort of privileged status.  in a few cases, i think this criticism may be legitimate; in other cases, not.  so i was interested to see if there were perhaps legitimate reasons to criticize survivors of the holocaust or their advocates in the jewish community.  (note:  i am not equating child abuse and the holocaust.  i am saying that when people speak up about terrible things, there is often a tendency to see them as whiners who are shirking their responsibilities.  all things do not have to be equally terrible to promote this societal reaction.)i didn't find anything in this book to convince me of that.  what i found was to me an unconvincing and highly subjective summary of the jewish reaction to the holocaust, in which the author claims that it did not become a big deal until a long time after it was over, and that it was made into a big deal for illegitimate reasons, but this discussion is so subjective and brief that i was not persuaded to adopt his point of view.  the bulk of the book consists of complaints that jewish organizations unfairly extorted money from countries such as switzerland.  the argument becomes fairly technical here and evaluating it is beyond me because i have never read the reports (""audits,"" etc.) to which the author refers.  but i think that focusing so narrowly on money misses the point.  i expected to see a general discussion of the ways in which the author alleges that an emphasis on the holocaust caused some jews to ""play the victim card,"" and what i got was a very indepth discussion of several fights about money about which i have no way of determining the truth of the author's allegations.to me it seems obvious that the holocaust was a terrible atrocity with devastating consequences for the jews, and many lives were destroyed or damaged as a result.  it seems reasonable to me that the jewish community would insist that society recognize the destruction and damage, and to the extent that this book detracts from this, i think it is unfortunate",0

853,"gerd ludemann writes, ""historical research shows with definite clarity that jesus was not raised from the dead...we must acknowledge...a worldwide historical hoax"", (190). a summary review of his treatment will be sufficient to demonstrate that his conclusion is preposterously more forceful than even his strongest individual argument can support.three streams of thought permeate ""the resurrection of christ"": gospel writers each reworked tradition so as to embellish, invent, or explain away; peter and paul experienced hallucination and ""vision"" experiences proceeding from self-deception; belief in the supernatural is for the ignorant and unscientific. each of these bespeaks either erroneous assumptions, or avoidance of two hundred years of scholarly response against counter-christian polemic. in his chapter ""translation and analysis of the early christian texts on the resurrection"", ludemann applies a pattern of subtexts which he titles ""purpose and tradition reworked"" (re. gospel writers), and ""historical elements"". in the former he charges the gospel writers with adding to early tradition simply to reinforce their individual apologetic, or perhaps (he intimates) to cover up some element of embarrassment. for example, ludemann asserts that we may conclude that joseph of arimathea was a member of the jewish council (which condemned jesus), but that mark (earliest gospel) ""likely"" invented notions that the same was waiting for the kingdom of god and had become a disciple of jesus. but ludemann needs to discredit such notions, for all four gospel writers record joseph as the rich council member that buried jesus in his own tomb. ludemann's case will be much weaker if jesus is actually buried in a tomb that could be checked later to refute resurrection claims or appearances. ludemann gets carried away with himself when he, in tabloid fashion, suggests that perhaps the gospel writer is trying to ""disinfect a tradition...of a dishonorable burial"" of jesus. this is entirely ad hoc and enjoys absolutely no support from the texts he purports to analyze. ludemann goes so far as to accuse matthew, mark and luke of being anti-jewish! (refer to the ridiculous appendix 3).is christianity a ""history of self deception""? ludemann invests in the rather high-risk prospect of hallucination; for the burden is on ludemann to successfully argue against several strains of evidence for the physical appearances of jesus available in the new testament. that any explanation can be posited does not equal all explanations are equally valid. ludemann simply fails to evince that we ought to prefer hallucination as that which is best attested to by the various strata of available evidence. 1 corinthians 15 is the new testament text historians consistently refer to as central to the discussion of jesus' multiple appearances. even critical scholars date the creedal portion of the text (vs. 3-5) to the early 30's ad. the discussion advances from death to burial to resurrection, three physical events. also, the post resurrection gospel narratives speak of jesus eating and offering his body for examination, as well as being hugged! ludemann though, convinced that he has dispensed with those gospel narratives after the fashion mentioned above, and prejudiced by his atheistic presuppositions, introduces hallucination. what accounts for these hallucinations? ""peter's vision is an example of unsuccessful mourning"" (165). paul's ""event had a character of light and, like the vision of john, happened in the spirit, i.e., in ecstasy"" (47). but paul does not report ""i was in the spirit"" as john does (see revelation 1). john is deliberately conveying a non-physical experience. paul is not. when paul does have opportunity to convey an actual ""in the spirit"" experience, he does so in terms appropriate to that experience (2 corinthians 12:2). so we have record of paul's ability to intentionally differentiate between the physical and the purely spiritual. ludemann employs his fanciful tendencies beyond credulity when he engages ""modern depth psychology"" to explain paul's conversion from zealous persecutor of christians to ""apostle-in-chief of a new program of salvation"" (170-171). so, we may more accurately adduce historical veracity from a study of paul's subconscious state, than from the widely accepted facts of jesus death, burial, empty tomb and appearances! ludemann's examination of history fails for he maintains a priori rejection of the supernatural. historians look for the best explanation of the evidence. yet ludemann writes, ""who decides at what point of historical study a `theological explanation' ought to begin"" (201). this is rife with misunderstanding. one need only confirm that an event occurred in history, regardless of theological implications.  also, simple and sophisticated philosophic arguments conclude that theism (thus supernaturalism) is an entirely logical proposition. yet ludemann quotes another author, ""[the disciples] believed in phantoms; ... imagined that they were surrounded by miracles; ... took no part whatsoever in the positive science of the time."" (175). this ignores the new testament textual evidence that initially jesus' disciples did not believe the resurrection had happened, and in other places they marveled at his many miraculous works. even their primitive sense of science informed their lack of expectation for such a miracle! ludemann is exactly right when he agrees with paul that if there is no resurrection, we should abandon christianity. sadly, he reaches the wrong conclusion. self deluded by a proliferation of ""one can imagine"", ""seems to indicate"", ""likely enough"", and ""one thus suspects"" reasoning, ludemann boasts ""accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer easter vision"".

854,"murky: in his book, 1984, orwell described a contrived language he called ""newspeak"", designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. but before orwell there were russell and whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. as whitehead wrote in his ""foreword"" to quine's ph.d. dissertation titled a system of logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought. thus in his ""on universals"" quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as ""entities"". and he co-authored with goodman ""steps toward a constructive nominalism"", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or ""platonists"" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. i believe that anyone who says that universals are ""referenced"" or who uses the phrase ""abstract entities"" fully deserves to be labeled a platonist. but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak. in the ""search inside this book"" screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared ""entities"" and are ""referents"" of predicates. i ask loux: what happened to signification? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. i ask loux: what happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. i ask loux: since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric? i see murky writing. muddled: loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing. ontological relativity started as an analogy: quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time. einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton's absolute time, and he rejected lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions. quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs. realism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories. but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity ""anti-realism"". in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. i do not find this book contemporary. loux's ""realism - anti-realism"" locution is a false dichotomy. i see muddled thinking. marginalized: while a student i found notre dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students. readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site. thomas j. hicke",0
855,"i wanted to like this book...  i enjoyed the first two in the series.  but this one left me a bit dry...  babylon rising: the europa conspiracy by tim lahaye and bob phillips.this continues the story of michael murphy, a college professor teaching biblical archaeology.  he is now heading off to iraq to follow a tip on the location of ""the handwriting on the wall"" from the days of daniel.  he's falling in love with a colleague who is in the same area, and he fears for her safety as things start to get dicey in his life.  talon and the mysterious seven are trying to eliminate him, and there are a few attempts on his life.  mixed into this story is a terrorist attack on new york designed to throw america into an economic and national panic, as well as to prompt the un to move their headquarters to the ancient city of babylon.  murphy, for someone who's pretty much a small fish in the large ocean, finds himself in the middle of all this...as i said, i really wanted to like this book.  the murphy character is likeable, and i enjoyed the action.  but the plotline was spotty and over the top.  murphy was using martial arts to take out everyone who attacked him (highly unlikely).  everything the terrorists tried to do was thwarted just in the nick of time (over the top).  the story attempted to be both a christian end times novel and a terrorist suspense novel, and they didn't do either one especially well.  murphy's growing infatuation with isis was rather repetitive with the ""she's so beautiful"" and ""could she be interested in me"" interludes.  and finally, none of the plotlines wrapped up.  you got to the end and thought ""so?""  fine if you're ready to read the next installment, but not good if you started here or you have to wait some months for the next one...part of me wants to be nice, give the book the benefit of the doubt, and rate it a ""3"".  but the authors are better than this, and i've come to expect more from someone who's been doing this for a long time...  if you're committed to the series, you'll want/have/need to read it, but just don't come in with your expectations very high..",0

880,"i know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. it went into great detail about what i should do if i got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of morning sickness, which is much more common. and some of the information was just plain wrong. i trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because i couldn't feel the baby move. it advised that i should call the doctor. when i did, i found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. unfortunately i found this out after i had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong.i would not suggest this book to anyone",0
881,"this book was a huge disappointment. sue grafton and kinsey meander all over california but come up with nothing of substance. the author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. the characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. for example, kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. it doesn't work because it isn't real. it is sue grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. the story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. when it was all over, i still didn't know why the murders had been committed. save your eyesight! do not bother picking up this book",0
882,"i was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. this is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.i usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  she told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which i took to mean just a passing reference, but when i read the book, it was treated more seriously than i thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.it is inexcusable, both on ms pierce's part and on scholastic's.  no matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. i believe that as a parent, i'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so i can make an informed decision.anise hollingshea",0
883,"i had never read a danielle steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. i was pretty disappointed. i agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, i would still like it. i think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. yes, i get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! in addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, ""so and so was a devoted mother"" and repeating this fact again and again and again. these flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. this book did not leave me wanting to read more of ms. steel's books. it is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading.",0
884,the only redeeming points of this book are the few conversations that the author has with his uncle. the rest is just quotations from other books. there is enough original material here for about a chapter and a half. the author was set on making a book out of it so he just padded it with things that other authors had said. i read it to the end though. probably because the author has a very nice writing style. he is probably a good playwrite though i have never read any of his plays. he just didn't have enough material for a book here. i'm surpised it got published,0
885,"i've read great reviews about this book so i finally bought it because i could not get it at my local library. never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - just plain bad..",0
886,"i know that as a wolf-lover i am a bit biased, but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect.  you see, in this story, three children are left alone.  a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in, because he wants to eat them.unfortunately, that's where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill.  this is just another stupid book that, summed up, says ""wolves are evil, ugly beasts who attack people!!  we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children!""yep, the wolf is depicted as evil in this book.  why couldn't they make it something that actually hurts people, like a bear or a mountain lion?  ignorance, that's why.  the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book.see, near the end, the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts.  they plan on luring him into their trap, to get rid of him.  the wolf instantly falls for it, which is lame.  wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth!it's practically traditional to make children's books with wolves as villains, and the chinese seem to loath wolves, but this book crosses the line.don't let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage, stupid, man-eating beasts.  if they already think so, you'd be neglecting mankind's need to know things even more by letting them read it.in other words, it's a terrible book.",0
887,"i couldn't read past the second chapter.  roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims.  it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of ""the bitter"".  ""your wives are your fields, so go to your fields as you like"" isn't meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran.  i'm not going to finish this book, because i'd rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic, oppressed ""other"" type of woman, thanks.",0
888,"i have been a huge fan of michael crichton for about 25 years.  however, this book is misleading and dangerous.  almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).  writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - mr. crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of ""references"" to support this premise.  tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.  i hope that someday mr. crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  there is a quote: ""with great power comes great responsibility.""  but in this case it would seem: ""with great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet.",0
889,"if you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book.",0
890,"i was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  it is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   normally i enjoy koontz books.",0
891,"i finished it because a friend recommended it, but had she not, i would have quit after page 20. i wasn't interested in the story or writing. i didn't find the story grotesque; i've read a lot worse dealing with the various topics in this book, but i just didn't find the protagonist very interesting. he went a bit nutty at the end and it is understandable given the situation.  we learn about why he had to stick so tenaciously to his religious beliefs, to redeem himself. his actions didn't seem out of line, either during the war or during the plague, given his dire predicament and previous behaviors and experiences.  i know this is a great example of a book written in second person, and perhaps for that it is worth reading.  i wouldn't pick it up for enjoyment or leisure",0
892,"god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic.  and yes, maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book's great reputation, i entered it with high expectations. - which the book however did not satisfy.  yes, it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time, a lampoon of the courtship ritual, and of course oh so witty, blah blah blah, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.  the main character was likeable, but that aside, i found it completely insufferable to read through, and absolutely painfully boring.  every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted, let alone the ending.  not that anything really ever happens - the entire book could be summed up with, ""then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea, walked and talked and had more tea, then got married and lived happily ever after.""  the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama.  it would save more time just to watch a chick flick.  so if you're interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters, witnessing the agony over who's going to marry who (even though the reader could already predict the happily-ever-after match-making light-years in advance), then this is the book for you!!  if not, then i suggest picking up some dan brown.",0
893,"i'm a big nora fan, but i couldn't even finish this one. by the fourth chapter i began to skim. way way way to much detail for me. which made it boring and slow. testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. enough! i did however enjoy the side story about the brother (i forget his name). but thats it folks. unlike all the other reviewers, i hated it. i say pass on this one. but as you can see, i'm in the minority",0
894,"should martha rules have included any information regarding her going to prison as a ""business decision""? i would have been interested in reading about the pr strategy used in this ""criminal spectacle"" designed to make the question of martha/mdiddy's innocence a moot point. are honest business practices being pushed to the side? by normalizing, generalizing, and minimalizing martha/mdiddy's crimes, are we loosing our morality? how important is integrity to a leader...former ceo of a company?be ""thoughtful",0
895,"having read detective comics #471-479 in the 70s done by this same creative team, i picked this up, hoping for more of the same. what a let-down! i have to ask - what happened!?the art on those erstwhile 70s issues was the finest, most detailed art i'd ever seen in a comic-book. i think that was due mostly to the inking of terry austin. when he was working on x-men, he gave john bryne's pencils that fine detail as well.has austin done a 'gil kane' and given up his nib-and-ink to work with marker-pen? this dark detective series shows none of the fine-ness of his previous work. you only have to compare the 'flash-backs' of this series to the original detective comics issues to see that something is wrong.maybe austin or rogers are getting older, but the artwork is very basic, and lacks the sheen they used to produce. the art sometimes actually reminded me of bob kane's early work.the story also is a little unbelievable. it portrays bruce as a love-sick puppy and just doesn't ring true. also, the lettering is - well, it's been hand-done, by rogers i surmise, and is quite uneven. it should have been done by computer.i'm sorry - i so wanted to like this, but it's nothing like the calibre of work that this creative team produced in their glory days of the 70s.",0
896,"this book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or european or is overly valued in american history textbooks.  loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  ""lies my teacher told me"" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic sociology professor.  the only reason i didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased",0
897,"reviewer alianore's opinion ""rather too indulgent of its subject"" is a very accurate portrayal of weir's work. i will try to add something to that near perfect review. (note: i listened to the unabridged audiobook of ""queen isabella"", 22 hrs on 18 cds).the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable, loaded with period details. the last third is the worst: weir's fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation -- nay, elevation -- of queen isabella to the role of long-suffering, much-wronged, highly-deserving, and late-redeemed just queen of england.this book is really ""subjective, rhetorical biographal dramatization"". i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis. it is rhetoric because of the endless ""weasel words"" (and expressions) used copiously throughout: ""some say"", ""it has been said"", ""many believe"", ""therefore we may assume"", ""it can be inferred"" ... this isn't just an attribute of her style ... it *is* her style comprehensively. these expressions occur many hundreds of times, commonly in conjunction with wier's subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light, always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons.equally irksome is weir's double-standard of historical psychological analysis. she is always 'declaring' for us the contents of isabella's thoughts. remarkable gift she has for this. many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful. but then moments later she will portray isabella's actions from a 21st century point of view ... always telling the reader how isabella must have, might have, could have, would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another ... often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present-day psychosocial interpretation of 800 year old history. this isn't historical writing, it is historical op-ed, with an obvious agenda.i don't loathe this work, it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail. the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing. but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography. (other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris' ""rise of theodore roosevelt"" and ""theodore rex"". i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject, lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence. yuck. really.)if prefer more history when reading (or listening to) history. and much, much less editorial subjectivity, retroactive psychology, biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation. the only way i could enjoy ""isabella"" by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly, taking it with ""several pounds of salt"" as the above referenced reviewer advises.2.5/5",0
898,"being an engineer in the aerospace industry i was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a ""hard industry."" i personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. so this book sounded like the perfect source
